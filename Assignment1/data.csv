sugar,"Sugar imports subject to the U.S. sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial week of the 1987 sugar quota year, totaled 5,988 short tons versus 46,254 tons the previous week, the Agriculture Department said.     The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year (January-December) has been set at 1,001,430 short tons compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was extended three months to December 31.     The department said the Customs Service has reported that weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight basis and when final polarizations are received, cumulative import data are adjusted accordingly.

trade,"inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.     Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate.     But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.     ""The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked,"" a leading bank economist said.     The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.  Reuter "

""The price reduction today was made in the light of falling oil product prices and a weak crude oil market,"" a company spokeswoman said.

grain,"A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.     Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters.     GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee.     The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.     The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program.     If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.     GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.     But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said.     The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it.  Reuter "
crude,"OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.     ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA.     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.     ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.     He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.     ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,"" he added.     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.     ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.     ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.     ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

cpi,"Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,"" the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said.  REUTER "
grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said.     However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future.     ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""     Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week.     But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months.     ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said.     ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"" said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program.     An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets.     But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time.     The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.     In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm, basic, factual economics.""     Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms.     USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.

grain,"U.S. farmers who in the past have grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the government that they had done so probably will be allowed to continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.     Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop.     Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits.     USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.  Reuter "
cpi,"France's right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year.     Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.     But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.     And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.     ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.""     ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained,"" he added.     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity.     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.     Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority.     But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.     ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas.     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said.     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.     ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs.     But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control.     Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added.     Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said.     So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.

The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.     The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1 pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct in September 1958.     Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall decline for the month.     Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities, gasoline and vegetables fell.     The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down 0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.  REUTER "
interest,"Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said.     They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau.     The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said.     The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.     However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.     The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said.     On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.     These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said.     Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.  REUTER "
gnp,"Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.     However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.     But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth.     The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.     Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.     ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said.     Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said.     ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said.     ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.""     Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.     ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,"" he said.     Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand.     He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income.     The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.     ""The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said.     ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he said.  REUTER "

coffee,"Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum.     The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices.     However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight.     World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil""s output by nearly two thirds.     Brazil is the world""s largest coffee producer and exporter.     Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said.     Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate.     The big producers ""want to have the ball only in their court and it isn""t fair,"" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said.     The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said.     Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.     But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics.     Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.     Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.     Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. ""Anything is possible at this phase,"" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.     If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said.     Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

grain,"Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.     Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia""s agricultural performance.     The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987.     The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.     ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,"" the report says.     ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.""     Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines.     The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields.     The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types.     The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices.     Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says.     But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.     The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand.     The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984.     The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump.  REUTER "
crude,"Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices.     Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.""     He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.     ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister said.     Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.     ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.     He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel.     Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel.     Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.""     Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.     However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added.     He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body""s members.     Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.     Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.""

crude,"Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.     To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September.     But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.     ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic performance.     It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""     ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"" the report says.     Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.     Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports.     The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,"" the report notes.     Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April.     But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.""     ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,"" the report states.     Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs.     A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.  REUTER "

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86.     In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.     Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion.     The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct.     He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves.     He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture.     No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.     Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day.

Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.""     Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.""     Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs.     Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.     He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord.     In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.

It forecast end-1987 stocks at around 290,000 tonnes.     The main suppliers in 1986 were Australia (44 pct), the U.S. (29 pct), Canada (12 pct), Argentina (8 pct) and Saudi Arabia (5 pct).  REUTER "
sugar,"Indonesia's raw sugar output is likely to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S. Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.     Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986, the report said.     The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of 1.99 mln.     It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived.

crude,"Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said.     They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers.     But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.     The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes.     Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end.     Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.     The four -- Exxon Corp XON>, Mobil Corp MOB>, Texaco Inc TX> and Chevron Corp CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.     However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.     Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices.     The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.     They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

oilseed,"Japanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said.     The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.     Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.     Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.     Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said.     In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.     Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.     Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988.     China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said.     ""This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them,"" it said.     Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.     ""Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"" the report said.  REUTER "

trade,"Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.     The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.     Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.     ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese government official said. ""But we are also frustrated.""     The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said.     He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.     ""It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied.     The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour.     On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.     The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.     These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.     Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.     Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports.     Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one Japanese official said.     That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.     Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.     Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.     ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted.     As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers.     The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.     The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year.     Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.     ""We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,"" he said.     The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective.      Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.     Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners.     A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.

The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.     But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both.     It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.  Reuter "
grain,"The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said.     The deadline for a final determination is March 7.     U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.     Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

coffee,"Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.     Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said.     Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely.     Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.     No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said.     A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said.

In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.     The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile ""will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work.""     Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment.     Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992.     The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way.     The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic.  Reuter "
sugar,"Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.     Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts.     The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.     Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month.     Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes.     Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said.  Reuter "

crude,"The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.      On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     ""This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,"" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.     Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.      The expanded program ""will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,"" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.      The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction.     Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials.     When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, ""Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.""     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  Reuter "

trade,"Canada's decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said      ""It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world,"" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.     U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually.     The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.    The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.     The council said ""in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.""     But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world.     The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against  allegedly subsidized exports.     A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized.     The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called ""cultural industries"" - publishing, broadcasting and films.     It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, ""acid rain"" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.  Reuter "
grain,"All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said.     The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments.     Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said.       Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.     ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" Jim Miller, president of NAWG said.     ""We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture,"" Miller said.  Reuter "

Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said.     Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.

gnp,"French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.     The report said the French economy was ""increasingly ill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.""     ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months,"" it said.     Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.""     This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said.     Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,"" it added.     But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.     Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.     ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,"" one OECD official commented.     OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct.     The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.     But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation.     With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said.     On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.     ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"" it said.

An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by ""somebody fanning the (wheat) market."" Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation.

He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. ""We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.""     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement.     He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire.     Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.     ""The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"" he said.     ""The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time,"" he said.     Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season.     The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said.

coffee,"The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.     Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.     A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said.     Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.     With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.     Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.     The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks.     Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, ""A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.     ""We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO.""     Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, ""Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them.""     Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme.     But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct.     Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it.     A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together.     Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings.     Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said.     The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast.     The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said.  REUTER "

A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters.     Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.     But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak.     U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.     Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.     The MITI spokesman said, ""If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure.""

No further details on the loan were immediately available.     Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.     The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.     The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.     Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.  REUTER "

trade,"China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.     But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.      The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.      ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,"" the editorial said.      ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).      ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added      The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.      He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.      The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.      A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.      He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.      The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.""      The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them.      China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said.      But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.      Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.      ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said.      Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.      In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT.      ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said.      ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation,"" he said.      The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.      In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance planning"" and economic levers.      The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do.  REUTER "

Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system.     The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon.     Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender.     Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.     But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.     ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.

He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil.     Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said.     He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: ""Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)."" He did not elaborate.     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties.     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. ""We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.""

ship,"Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters.     Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.     ""There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking,"" a union spokesman said.     Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.

coffee,"This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.     ""The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again,"" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.     ""The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality,"" he said.     ""Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks,"" the roaster added.     Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.     ""There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement,"" he said.     ""There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation,"" de Vries added.     With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

coffee,"The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.     In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.     The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added.     ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year,"" he said.     The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.     Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.     Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.     Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added.     ""This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development,"" he said.     ""It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ...

trade,"Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could react was to retaliate.     De Croo said at a news conference ""if you limit textile imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe.""     And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.     Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners.     A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal.     De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, ""the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems.""     He said if a textile bill was enacted, ""we will impose taxes on a lot of American products.""  He said ""it would be stupid. We have to avoid that.""     He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted  shipments of Asian textiles.     De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying ""each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.""     He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.

trade,"House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.     In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.     But he warned that his ""conciliatory message"" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.     ""Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"" Rostenkowski said.     ""It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market,"" he added.     However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.  Reuter "
coffee,"The prospects of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation, said.     ""There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas,"" Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the delegations.     A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas.

trade,"Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said.     Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.     A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years.     Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services.     The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.     Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.     The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. ""Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at.""     ""You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"" Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.     He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list.  REUTER "
coffee,"Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said.     Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.     An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.     Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet.     However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop.     Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years.     Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries.     It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said.

trade,"House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.     He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.     However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.     There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.     Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases.     On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection.     ""To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"" he said.     This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year.  Reuter "
coffee,"Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said.     Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986.     A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected.     Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.     Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.     He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.     He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members.  Reuter "

gnp,"Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said.     ""The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987,"" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct.     In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter.     ""Essentially it is a flat performance,"" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.     Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number.""     ""We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she added.     The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year.     Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.     Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.     ""The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the federal agency said in a statement.     The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.     But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.  Reuter "

grain,"Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.     Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.     But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.     ""From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),"" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said.     The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.     ""Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.     The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said.     With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.     Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.     ""Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" Martell said.     Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said.     Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said.     Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.     ""The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now,"" a USDA official said.     But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.     Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.     ""A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,"" Martell said.

crude,"Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said.     ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added.     Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december.     The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.     The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.     ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,"" Margoshes said.     He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.     Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.     Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart.     Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.""     He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions.     Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market.     Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments.     North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.     OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.     Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.     ""The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,"" Margoshes said.     Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.     But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short.     Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

coffee,"Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said.     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close.     The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said.     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.     In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. ""If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried,"" Dauster said, adding ""now it is time to go and sell coffee.""     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year.     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market ""in one go"" but is sold over a minimum of six months.     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said ""objective criteria"" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said.     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ""ad hoc"" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.     It is a ""simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different ""objective criteria"" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.     ""We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,"" one delegate said.     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed.     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found.     ""Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,"" one consumer said.  Reuter "

grain,"Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.     Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.     Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.     The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments.     Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January.     National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.     Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate.     The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said.     Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said.     The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.  Reuter "

In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne.      For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said.     Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said.     In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.     But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90.     The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said.  Reuter "

In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices.     If the reports are confirmed, China's major export destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.     China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said.  Reuter "
crude,"Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.     Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.     ""Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down,"" Wellemeyer said.     ""The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said.     In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.     Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.     Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil.  Reuter "
grain,"The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains.     EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said.     The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.     The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.     It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

grain,"Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year.     The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said.     Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.     But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said.  Reuter "
grain,"Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets.     Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.     Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.     With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances.     An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said.     Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added.     Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton.     One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

trade,"Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.     ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" he said.      ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure,"" he said.     The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs.     Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted.     Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant.     The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.     Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.     He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.     The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.     ""The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition,"" he said.

The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.     The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987.     Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier.

interest,"The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets.     Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England.     The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.     The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments.     Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain.     Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.     The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.     The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost.     Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset.     The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.     They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.     Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities.     They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets.     However, the staff concluded, ""The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations.""     The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.     Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges.     Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules.  Reuter "

livestock,"The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said.     The ministers agreed that under this ""extensification"" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct.     The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added.     Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.     The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego.     The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment.     It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock.     The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added.     At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers.     Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition.""     EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production.     The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments.     Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed.  Reuter "

coffee,"Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by ""objective criteria"", U.S. officials said.     Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.     Rosenbaum said the United States will be ""flexible"" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas.     At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.     Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas.     He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but ""nobody is proposing we change our position.""     However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position.     ""Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,"" said one U.S. official.     The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London.     This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said.     The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said.     El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria.     There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said.     Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions.     In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.     This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.     However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks.     A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.     While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.     U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.  Reuter "
grain,"Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May.     The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.     Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.     No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.     Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.     Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.     Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area.     Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest.     Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.     Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.     Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.     Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.  Reuter "

Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme.     If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments.     Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it.

sugar,"India bought up to 10 cargoes of white sugar at a buying tender today which originally called for just two to three cargoes of March/April shipment, traders said.     London trader E D and F Man said it sold two cargoes at 233 dlrs a tonne CIF for March/April shipment with an option to sell an additional two cargoes at the same price.     Traders said at least one other international trader made a similar contract while a French house sold two cargoes at an outright price of 233 dlrs CIF without the option. This brought total Indian purchases to at least six cargoes with traders having options to sell another four.  Reuter "

bop,"Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said.     He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.     Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year.     This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.     Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.     ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,"" he added.     His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.     ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.     Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits.     Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.     ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986.     More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered.     ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.     He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.

crude,"Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said.     Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said.     ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.     Few new wells now are being drilled.     Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity.     ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity.     Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association.     While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell.     Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs.     More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said.     ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"" Malmgreen said.     Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.     The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.     In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl.     Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled.     ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,"" Mitchell said.     No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said.     Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production.     Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission.     In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.     Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.     Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation.     ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"" Guerard said.  Reuter "
grain,"The government daily Izvestia said a considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil.     Without giving figures, the newspaper said: ""A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring.""     The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.     A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years.     ""The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple,"" Izvestia said.     This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

grain,"The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement.     Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop.     An official from a leading conservation group, who asked not to be identified, said the panel's move was ""an unfortunate first action"" because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations, established under the 1985 farm bill.

According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86 period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes (919,337).     British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and January 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800 tonnes, ONIC figures showed.     But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.     ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community countries was due to British competition.  Reuter "
grain,"The size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.     He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.     Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention.     A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.     The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.  Reuter "

The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy ""substantial amounts of cotton"" from the U.S.     He noted his country ""is clearly not as open as the American market.

grain,"The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.     The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers.     ""They're all lower,"" he said. ""This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.""     Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.     Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.     If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.     The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet.     Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.     But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.  Reuter "

This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.     The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors.     The E.C.

The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.     Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate.

He noted, however, that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.

crude,"Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.     Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers.     His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production.     Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.     Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel.     ""We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,"" Nugent said. ""In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.""     Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

coffee,"Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas.     ""We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions,"" Gaviria told Reuters in an interview.     The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.     Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible.     In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries.     He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.     According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue.     That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.

interest,"U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.     After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk.     Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals.     Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals.     ""What they are proposing is really double counting,"" Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.     ""The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected,"" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. ""What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now,"" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).     Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers.     Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules.      Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other.     The paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk."" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.     But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.      ""One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank official.  Reuter "

The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.     The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.     Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975.     Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was.     ""We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices,"" Melnikov said.     ""I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988,"" he said.

Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea.

She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues.     Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.

""How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?"" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.     ""We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices,"" he said in an interview.     Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices.     ""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said.     Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.""     ""The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?"" he said.     The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.     Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.     ""If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered,"" he said.     Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.  Reuter "

""Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced,"" Kleckner said.     The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market.     A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate.     The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather.  Reuter "
trade,"A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system.     Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate.""     His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.     Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress.     De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.     Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.     Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.     Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.     ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he said.     Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes.     He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.     ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.""     Channon added that ""There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines.""     He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better.""     He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.     He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding ""if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?""      reuter "
sugar,"China's 1986/87 sugar crop has been revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline seven pct from 1985/86.     Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at 837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down five pct from the previous season, while cane output is projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.

trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.     Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.     ""They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy,"" he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.     Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.     The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said.

coffee,"The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said.     He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.     ""Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"" Calmon added.     Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.     ""It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction,"" he added.     In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags.     Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.     The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe it was higher than this.  Reuter "

coffee,"Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long.     Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions.     ""I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,"" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks.     Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982.     Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues.     He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month.     Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.     ""An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,"" he said without elaborating.     ""Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,"" he said.     Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.     Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo.     Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation.     A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed ""his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future"" despite the commodities price slide.     The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.     Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.     Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.  Reuter "

The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months.     The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers.     The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.

""We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future,"" Lo said.     He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea.     Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs.     But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery.

He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport, agricultural products and car telephones.     He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased, he said.  REUTER "

gnp,"The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said.     The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.     In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies.     ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.""     The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges.     They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year.     West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said.     However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours.     The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation.     It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course.     The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world.     Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home.     The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.  REUTER "

trade,"Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago.     Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.     But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate.     They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.     ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.     The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission.     According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders.     But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.""     A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed.     Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.     Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.""     ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.     Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry.     ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,"" said one Western envoy.     He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry.     Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently.     Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""     While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said ""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.""     Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States.     He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.""     He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""     Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role.     ""As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

trade,"Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show.     Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln.     For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.     Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.     The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.     In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.     The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said.     However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion.     The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.     The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available.  REUTER "

crude,"OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.     The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.     They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.     OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.     The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals.     But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to export as much as its quota allows.     Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.     Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.     Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.     Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March.     Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.     Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.     Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.

interest,"Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.     The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.     Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth.     ""I think it's a good measure,"" a senior foreign banker said. ""It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.""     ""It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run,"" he added.     The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates.     But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive.     The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago.     To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices.     Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.     Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard.     The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.     Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.     The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher.     A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates.  REUTER "

oilseed,"The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase, the president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.     ""The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want, but they have to eventually address this problem,"" David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.     USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan, Haggard said.     ""I don't know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem,"" he said.     At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.     The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.

coffee,"Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said.     He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries.     The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.     It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.     Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions.     ""We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic,"" Dauster added.     He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.     ""Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,"" Dauster said.     Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.     ""It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover,"" he said.     The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said.     Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.     Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present.     He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although ""no hypothesis has been abandoned.""     Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened.     He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested.     He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.     He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April.  Reuter "
crude,"OPEC output in February was ""well below"" the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.     The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result ""of member countries' firm determination to defend the organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.""     The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25.     The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that ""the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.""     ""No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail,"" the statement said.     ""The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price,"" the statement said.     Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.     There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets.     The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled ""because of member countries' firm determination to defend the price (system)"" agreed in December.     Opec""s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.     Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Nigeria and Qatar.  REUTER "

Most economists said they did not expect the Fed to add reserves with Federal funds trading below six pct.     They said the funds rate's softer tone may indicate that the need to add reserves in the current bank reserve maintenance period is smaller than previously estimated.     Fed funds opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained at that level. Yesterday funds averaged 6.01 pct.  Reuter "
livestock,"A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines.     Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle.     Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.     Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans.     But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.     The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness.     They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, ""the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked.""     The researchers said the results show that ""food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms.""

gnp,"Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say.     Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.     But whatever the government's response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.     The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy.     Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct.     Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook.     The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.     The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.     Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.     Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.     But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.     Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.     Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates.""     Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal.     Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits.     Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.     Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.     Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.     One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden.     A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said.  REUTER "

This brings recent options India has given traders to some 200,000 tonnes at fixed prices and makes future Indian purchases very dependent on price fluctuations, traders said.

Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.     He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets.     Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.

The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.     The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.

In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program.     The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.     ""This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect,"" Wehler said.

interest,"The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.     It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.     Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to.     The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage.     ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. ""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.""     This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound.     The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50.     ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.     Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.     However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.     There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.     Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said.     An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year.     Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.     However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.     The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.     Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.     They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington.     The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,"" he added.     The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.     Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.     This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.     Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.     The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.  REUTER "

sugar,"Turkey is holding a buying tender for 100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.     The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.     Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount.     Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.     Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.     Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish 1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three seasons.

gnp,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made.     ""It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth,"" he told the Eastern Economic Association.     Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts. ""Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction,"" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.     On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending.     There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.     But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable.     ""This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending,"" he said.     A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.     He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.     On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against ""quick fix"" solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation.     ""What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth,"" he said.     Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time.  Reuter "

Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.     The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ, Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and added there was now no alternative to proceeding with redundancy plans.     The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19 in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.     Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss figures given for the port for this year.     The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ, put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985 at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around 30 mln.     The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.  Reuter "
ship,"Striking Brazilian seamen, who say they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports, today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said.     Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.     Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.     The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.     Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.     Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government, which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance.     The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.     ""Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is not conceivable that exports be hit,"" he said.     ""But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad, and all this through the fault of the seamen,"" Rubens Habbema said.     A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its normal level of 12 ships a day.     He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor on moored in the harbour.  Reuter "
trade,"A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said ""Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now.     ""Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down.""     He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits.     Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well.     ""We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"" Yeutter said.     He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a ""level playing field"" for trade.     The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down.     On the fiscal side, Yeutter said ""the budget deficit is still our biggest problem"" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit.     In the international area, he said that ""our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."" Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said ""Japan is just not doing the job on the import side.""     Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.     In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.     ""The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end,"" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, ""the dollar will be the equalizer.""     Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers.     He said ""there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem.""     Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.     ""There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation,"" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.

trade,"Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade.     Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.     ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement.     ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the meeting.     Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports.     He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar.     Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"".     ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added.     Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September. Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking, tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods.  Reuter "
grain,"A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or ""de-coupling,"" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.     It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said.     Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.     Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said.     The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.     Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.     Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.     An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary.     Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.     But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops.     There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.     Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.     Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill.     ""Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing,"" a congressional staff member said.     Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains.  Reuter "
grain,"China has added 90,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat to its purchases for delivery in the 1987/88 season and cancelled 30,000 tonnes of wheat purchases for delivery in the 1986/87 season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     According to the department's Export Sales Report covering transactions in the week ended February 26, China has outstanding wheat commitments for the 1986/87 season of 30,000 tonnes and 420,000 tonnes for delivery in the 1987/88 season.     The wheat season begins June 1.     China has total corn commitments for 1986/87 of 1,011,200 tonnes and soybeans commitments of 157,500 tonnes.     The season for corn and soybeans began September 1.  Reuter "
crude,"Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices.     Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     ""We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"" he said. ""I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,"" he said.     Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures.     Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; ""That could well be correct.""     Opec""s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was ""well below"" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures.     But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.     The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd.     Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.     Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.     Lukman said that some industry reports ""may be correct"" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.     He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States"" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.     However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.     ""We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,"" he said, adding that he expected it to go ""up and up"" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria""s.     The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products.     Also, some of Venezuela""s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said.     Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to ""dangerous levels,"" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil.     ""When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,"" he said.     Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak.     He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment.     ""At this time, we have to get our priorities right,"" he said. ""The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.""     But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.  Reuter "
livestock,"Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle producing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.     The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the island's number two province in milk production. Granma said 20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.     The newspaper said a ""cattle emergency"" had been decreed and the cattle are being rounded up.     Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.     Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana, each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every 18 days.     In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no rain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of silage projected in its annual plan.     Granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than 50 pct of normal precipitation.  Reuter "

trade,"Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance.     Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production.     ""It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said.     Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment.     The need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalance and tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said.     And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted.     Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas.     Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.     Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.     However, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said.     ""Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community,"" he said.  Reuter "

livestock,"Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. congress not to change the farm bill. While there are no specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices directly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said.     Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said ""to have unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption.""     Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.     Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that Congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify problems in the farm credit system.     Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a  resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.     Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save or create any one credit system.   Reuter "

They also said the heating oil contract found additional support from a short-covering rally on the close.     April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.     ""Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota,"" said Simon Greenshields, a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.     News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices, traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd.     In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.     Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon.  Reuter "

In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.     Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.     Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and 151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from the previous week's combined sales, it said.     Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by 30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.     Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico and Italy, it said.     Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less than the four week average.     Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations.     Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for unknown destinations.     Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales -- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the 1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good showing, the department said.

coffee,"The sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation, finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.     He said the current depression on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on Colombia's financial state which he described as sound.     ""Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"" he said.     Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs.     Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.     Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of 3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years, which he said was approved.

grain,"Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said.     The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat.     This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.     Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92.     The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.     Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92.     ""The timing (of the proposal) is off,"" said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member.     However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package.     Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs.     A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings.     A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years.     Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.     Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains.     If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.  Reuter "
trade,"The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.     ""It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade,"" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.     To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said.     Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.     Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.     U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights.

coffee,"Brazil's recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.     The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.     ""That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation,"" Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said.     Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable.     ""Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates,"" Roldan said.     The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs.     But he added: ""They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels.""     Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance.     Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence.     ""Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed,"" one senior coffee dealer said.     The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer.     Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said.     ""If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"" he said.     New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.     President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas.     Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. ""They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"" according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.     Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. ""Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops,"" he said.     The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields.     ""We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,"" Loewy said.     Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.     Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.     Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.     He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan.     ""We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export,"" Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.     Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation.     He said the debt situation was a major consideration. ""The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage,"" he added.     Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference.     On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital.     Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said.     Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. ""Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it,"" one analyst said.     ""If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that,"" she added.  Reuter "
crude,"OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.

It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.     The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.     The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.

The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).     Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute.     He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.

coffee,"Costa Rica's economy minister said he sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas.     Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing- nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.     Escalante told a news conference here he ""carried the weight of the negotiations"" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.     Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand.     ""There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas,"" Escalante said.     At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said.     The current ICO quota system is ""unfair and autocratic,"" Escalante said.     Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand.     ""Be careful,"" he warned, ""there's not as much coffee in the world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust.""  Reuter "

interest,"The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.     The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.     The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted.     The Bank of France's ""open market"" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates.     For the moment the sentiment is of ""wait and see"" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.     Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed.     The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.     Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.     There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.     Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.     Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.     Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues.     These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.

interest,"The Belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988.     The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.     The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.     The team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s.""     However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989.     The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986.     The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government.""     It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.     ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the report adds.     The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation.     It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.     It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs.  REUTER "
interest,"This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct.     But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said.     Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.     Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.     A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.     Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range,"" he said.     Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area.     However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.     ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market.     Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs.     The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.     But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels.     He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said.     Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice.     However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.     ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.     He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term.     However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day.     The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton.     The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.     ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group.     Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.     This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.     However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.  REUTER "

crude,"U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall.     ""OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,"" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. ""That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,"" he added.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.     The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel.     ""Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,"" McKinley said.     Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year.     IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.     Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.     Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price.     ""This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview.     For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week.     Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.     ""This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,"" McKinley said.     International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week.     If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters.     But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.     Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower ""because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.""      He added, ""The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,"" he added.     There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.     Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.     Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.     ""There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,"" one international trader said.  Reuter "
sugar,"The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE) will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.     Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December, 1985.     The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of 55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages.     Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated by the symbol ""HF,"" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of March, May, July, September and December.     Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation of one dlr per CWT.     ""We hope the producers and users of fructose will be actively involved, those producers being the large processors, the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage bottlers,"" Henderson said. ""But there are potentials for all types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries that utilize fructose.""  Reuter "

ship,"Strikes by Brazil's 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis.     A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.     On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance.     Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices.     There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.     The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.     The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled ""Dangerous Confrontation,"" said: ""From the economic point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country's external trade.""     The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct.     Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal's ruling.     Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.     Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.     Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).     Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could.

grain,"Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.     An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.     Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said.    If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said.    English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.     Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said.     Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.     An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops.     Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said.     Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program.

grain,"Canada's ruling in favor of a duty on U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the association.     ""The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed"" in their complaint, Hall told Reuters.     A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel.     ""This was cleary a political decision,"" Hall said. ""The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.""     The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.     Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U.S. farm programs.     The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.  Reuter "

The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cents a bushel.

interest,"Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said.     The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.     ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists.     But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.     Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses.     ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.     Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.     Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.     The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook.     With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices.     Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook.     Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.     ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.     The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely ""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at tremendously high levels.""     Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.  Reuter "

gnp,"Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris.     Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief.     An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.     The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.     Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax.     An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies.     The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.     The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain.     The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.     Stoltenberg said: ""We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment.""

Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.     Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present.     ""Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,"" he told BBC radio.     As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called ""RoRo"" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.     In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads.     Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards.     But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design.     Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge.     ""As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,"" he said.     Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.     ""If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,"" he added.  REUTER "

Little oil was lost in the landslide Friday night because taps on the one mln bpd line were switched off after the accident, they said.

ship,"Hundreds of marines were on alert at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court yesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.     The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.     ""We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our protest until the end,"" a union leader said.     He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and let the marines handle the situation by themselves.     A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.     Petrol station owners in four states also continued their shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.  REUTER "
crude,"The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.     The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports.     It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America.     In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.     A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

interest,"Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say.     ""At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,"" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said.     The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.     Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.     This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.     But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.     Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May.     One finance ministry economist said ""It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased."" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt.     Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.     With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.     Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.     The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion.     The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form.     Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. ""The problem here will be the tax reform,"" the portfolio manager said.     He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings.     The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.     The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term ""Kassenobligation"" notes.     A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year.     Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect.     ""I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,"" the manager said.     Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.     But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark.     ""The demand wasn't so good,"" a dealer for a German bank in London said.     The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said.  REUTER "

crude,"Japanese customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.     NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.     Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.      Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said.     Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.     Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said.      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. ""It's just disguised cheating,"" one Japanese trader said.     The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the price related to processing arrangements.

trade,"The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.     The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December.     It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.     It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.     ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said.     It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse.     To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said.     On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly sick.""     Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said.     On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.  Reuter "
interest,"Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said.     The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited.     The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany.     ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said one banker who attended the symposium.     A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.     But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.     ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,"" the second source said.     In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said.     Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, ""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that.""     The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.     Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.     For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.     The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation.     One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany's economic growth.     Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation.     This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January.     The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.     Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.     Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

gnp,"Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning agency CPB said.     The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.     Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase from last year's 423.95 billion.     The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.     ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said.     More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.     Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.     Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last year, the CPB said.     Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness.     In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers.     The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year, urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future.     Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.     It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this year from 710,000 last year.     While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.     Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own latest estimate.     ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said.     The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.     Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.     The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1 billion last year, the CPB forecast.  REUTER "

coffee,"Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board, CMB, said.     ""This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee,"" J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday.     Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.     Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically.     Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.     The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags.     For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.     The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower.     In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks.

crude,"The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.     The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports.     It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America.     In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.     A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

trade,"The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.     The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December.     It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.     It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop.     The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.     ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.     It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse.     To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said.     On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly sick.""     Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said.     On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.     However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said.     After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.     It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.  Reuter "
trade,"A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics.     The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct.     He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October.     Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include:     - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period;     - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada"" provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision;     - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation;     - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers;     - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.      Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.     The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.     He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.     Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers.     He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production.     Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product.     Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations.

grain,"Three London markets which trade potato, soymeal and meat futures said they will merge to form a new Agricultural Futures Exchange.     Legal advisers have been instructed to implement the amalgamation of the London Potato Futures Association, LPFA, the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, and the Grain and Feed Trade Association's, GAFTA, Soya Bean Meal Futures Association, SOMFA. No timetable was given.     Members of the three exchanges have been consulted, Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright told Reuters, and no objections have been raised to the merger.     Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange could ultimately combine five markets.     Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the other markets, market officials said.     The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members are consulted at a meeting on March 16.     The grain futures market also intends to consult its members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said.     The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE, for trading to continue.     Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE structure since the beginning of the year.     The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE ""at the appropriate time,"" the Agricultural Futures Exchange said.     ""This commitment by the markets will enable progress to be made to develop a stronger and more effective exchange to the benefit of all those involved in the industry,"" the chairman of the formation committee, Pat Elmer, said.

interest,"The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 ""B.""  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.     The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news.     Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength.     The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.     The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.     However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut.     Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.     Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.     Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market.     To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains.     Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's.     However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.

crude,"Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland.     Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.     Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.     ""We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,"" Petro-Canada said.     The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.     ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there,"" the company said.     Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said.     Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.     Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office.     Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added.     Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.     Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.     The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.  Reuter "

interest,"The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.     He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. ""The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates,"" he said.     The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.     The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said.     Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.     Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said.     Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency.     Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.     The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However, for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants.

It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds.

The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said.     Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies.     Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.     Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved.

The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.     The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.     Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.     The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to ""abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation.""     The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely severed.  "
bop,"The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.     The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased.     While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices.     The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.     The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  REUTER "

interest,"Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.     The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.     ""Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,"" one dealer said.     Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. ""We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already,"" one eurosterling specialist said.     ""Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money,"" he added.     This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.     Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.     A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest.     This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat.

grain,"The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.     Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains.     Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.     However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.     Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market.     Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to ""as soon as five months after harvest as possible,"" rather than the current year lag time.     Neither Rep.

grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.     In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers.     USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985/86 figure.     Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.     USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly from the previous January's level, while milk production increased by nearly six pct.     Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier, USDA said.  Reuter "

For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.     In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.

Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential.     The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties.     ""an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added.  "
gnp,"European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic.     The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.     It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports.     But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels.     ""Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic,"" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting.     The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.     But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.     The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth. "

""This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,"" DiBona said.

A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.     ""One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,"" the spokesman said.     Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor.     A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. ""We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,"" he added.     It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said.     ""If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,"" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.     The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest.     In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area.     This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.     Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members.     One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating.     ""There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,"" he said.     The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. ""The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,"" he said.     He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. ""This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,"" he said.     Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month.     Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area.     The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts.     ""Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,"" one MidAm trader said.     Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August.  Reuter "
grain,"Grain analysts said the increase of three mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to affect the market Tuesday.     They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.     In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.     ""That was business already done, for all practical purposes,"" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson, reflecting similar statements made by other analysts.  Reuter "
gnp,"A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.     The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct ""represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long.""     Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru's export potential.     The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties.     ""An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added.     The world bank report said the government's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness.     It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, ""the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments.""     It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency.     The government's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added.

grain,"The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said.     ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters.     ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers from all sources at this point,"" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.     This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years.     A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's recent interest.     Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said.     ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added.     USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.     The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again.     ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now,"" the official said.     However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.     Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.   Reuter "
crude,"T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.      Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990.      Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981.      ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs,"" he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58.      Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography ""Boone,"" said he does not believe the U.S. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry.

ship,"The search continued for a cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour Friday.     A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.     A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.     Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.     The ferry's owner is European Ferries Plc>, majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc PORL.L>.     The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies estimated to be trapped amid debris.     ""The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect one working day out of four,"" said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. He estimated the job itself would require 35 working days.     Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raise the ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside.     Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel routes from England to continental Europe.     Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicle loading doors, set close to water level.     In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in through the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry into the disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed.     Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship's doors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added.     Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun, one Belgian and one by the ferry's owners.  REUTER "
trade,"There is little chance Soviet exports to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future, a Soviet economist said.     Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want.     But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future.     Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.     But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year.     ""The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit its trading with the U.S.,"" he said.  REUTER "
grain,"The Sichuan government has ordered that any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and manpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said.     Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought.     Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural producer.     Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said.     The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water.     The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought.     Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since May.  REUTER "
trade,"Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.     But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said.     U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.     ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe.     Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls.     The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.     U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.     But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.     ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have.""     Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.     ""The best way to lower cost is to produce more,"" said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.     Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said.     Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said.     ""It's like tax avoidance schemes,"" said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. ""As soon as you close one route, another opens.""     MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance.     ""It's getting to be like communism,"" said one.     But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.     ""They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses,"" Bache's Wolffe said.     MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best.     ""There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"" said one U.S. Spokesman. ""The companies have a varying degree of urgency.""     The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.     Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.     Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they said.     Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.     Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.     ""The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't even have an office here,"" a source close to the industry said. ""You could question just how committed they are.""     In addition, some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.     ""(South) Korea's gaining market share,"" said one analyst. ""They're the real winners from the agreement.""  REUTER "
interest,"Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.     ""The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"" he told a press conference.     His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days.     At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.     Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.     He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.  REUTER "

A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000 tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.

crude,"King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.     His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month.     King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December.     The King replied: ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.""     Non-OPEC countries ""must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone,"" he said.     Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark.     In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.     A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.     The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said.  REUTER "

bop,"China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.     Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct.     China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.     Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.     Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.     A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market.     The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.     A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct.     The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.     ""Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,"" he said.     The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.     ""Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China,"" he said.     ""The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,"" he said.     The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against ""bourgeois liberalism,"" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.     A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.     ""The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,"" he said.     The banker said such buying has not been going on. ""Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.""     Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.     A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago.     The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.     The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases.     ""We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,"" he added.     Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.     A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct.     ""We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,"" he said.     He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  REUTER "

interest,"A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.     March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31.     This year the situation has been made worse by December's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah.     ""A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April,"" one U.S. Banker said.     The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high.     Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.     Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the ""speculators"" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems.     Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then.     ""Some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election,"" one banker said. ""They normally try to do things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia) meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars.""

London traders said bids for licences have been reported between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.     Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of between 43 and 43.50 Ecus.     Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export, the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales into intervention in protest against EC export policies.     Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a maximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus.  REUTER "
trade,"South Korea will further open its market to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government spokesman said.     The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae's stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government's determination to stand firm.     Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ""Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised.""     Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen ""The government's policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position.""     Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.     Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.     But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached ""a crisis level.""     An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said if the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.     ""We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts,"" the spokesman said. ""The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports.+     The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run ""a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country, like many other developing countries, which is reneging on its international obligations.""     The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.     He said South Korea was selecting ""many"" of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given.     Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items, including sensitive agricultural products and large cars, effective from July.     South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight billion dlrs this year.     But the government official said the surplus would be held at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.  REUTER "
interest,"Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.     ""The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"" he told a press conference.     His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days.     At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.     Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.     He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.  REUTER "
interest,"The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said.     The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.     In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a ""megabank,"" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground.     The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that ""exit bonds"" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters.     ""All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,"" said the official, who asked not to be named.     In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.     In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.     ""The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,"" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception.     The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.     ""We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,"" the official said.     Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a ""megabank"" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called ""exit bonds"" for banks like regional American or European institutions.     Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.     He emphasised that the ""megabank"" was not an administration plan but ""something some people have suggested.""     Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described.     But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States.     ""If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will.""     He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.     Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor.     ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said.     Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes.     These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor.     Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.     But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. ""It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,"" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. ""Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,"" he added.     He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.  Reuter "

Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years with 8-1/2 years' grace at 1-1/4 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2.     The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year.

oilseed,"Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.     Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.     ""Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,"" Balletto said.     Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.     He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.     Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.     ""If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,"" he said.     ""This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,"" Balletto said.     Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said.     World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year.     The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said.     World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower.     Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said.     Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.     The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.     Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes.     ""During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program.""     ""Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.     For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program.     ""Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate.""     The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.  Reuter "

interest,"Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.     Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.     High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said.     Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.     Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.     They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another.     The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank.     ""It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"" one banker said.     Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for Brazil's debt stance.

trade,"There is little chance Soviet exports to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future, a Soviet economist said.

Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm.     President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake.     Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.

crude,"The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said.     The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade.      ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.     Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd SLB>, Halliburton Co HAL>, Dresser Industries DI>, Baker International BKO>, and McDermott International Inc MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor.     Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S.     ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.     The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co HT> figures show.     The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said.     Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said.     ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt.     Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock.     ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said.     ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,"" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.     Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs.     Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.     Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said.     Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.  Reuter "
crude,"OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.     He told a news conference here ""After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.""     Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.     ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.     Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva.     The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.     Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level.     ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukman said.     He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd.     Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.     ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said.     He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.     ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,"" he said.     Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.""     Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude.     ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"" Lukman said.     The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market.     ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.     Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.

He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986).     This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added.     Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year.     But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.     Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.     One Western commercial attache here said: ""Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods.""     Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry.     It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market.     Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen.     He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation.     ""I am for credits to invest for that purpose,"" he said. ""I am against credits for consumption."" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.    Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low.     Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.

crude,"Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said.     Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.     Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.     The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.     ""All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,"" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said.     Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said.     Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said.     Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients.     But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course.     Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.     Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.  REUTER "

bop,"The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.     The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance.     The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.     Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan.     On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.     Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought.     Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.     The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.     In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.     Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs.     Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct.     The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.  Reuter "

sugar,"Thai sugar production totalled 960,788 tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization.     November and December production figures also exceeded last year's totals with the result that output in the first three months of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86. Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled 1.29 mln tonnes.     Thai exports in December and January were down, however. January exports fell from 73,164 to 35,910 tonnes.     Domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln tonnes by the end of January, compared with 1.52 mln a year earlier.     Thai Agricultural Ministry officials have previously forecast a decline in 1986/87 raws output to around 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.  Reuter "
gold,"St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property in northwestern Ontario.     It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue underground development and obtain operating permits and another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete underground development, construct a mill and provide the infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial production.     St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces.     The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.     It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily.     St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.     The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading 0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.

interest,"U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday.     The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market.     The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.     They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later.     The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct.      It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.     ""That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,"" said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; ""It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more.""     Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was ""of considerable significance.""     It said, ""the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.""     Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates.     Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.     ""National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months,"" he said.     He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation.     Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct.     Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.     But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts.     ""The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this,"" one senior dealer said.     A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market.     ""We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,"" he told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates.     He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.     In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show.     Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said.  REUTER "

sugar,"The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said.     It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal.     The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.     The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.     Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).     Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280).     On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88.     Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln.

crude,"Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.     They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages. However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties.     Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.     ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.     ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.     Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them.     Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.     In two of the biggest transactions of recent months, French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.     A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, Petrofina S.A.> and Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos WMB>, the Oklahoma pipeline firm.     But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with Dupont's DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.     Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.     Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of Preussag Corp> and C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.     But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.     ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need prices higher than the current market,"" he added.     In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties.     Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.     ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""  Reuter "

The 19.1 mln dlr assistance agreement was signed by Jordan's Minister of Energy Hisham al-Khatib and PCIAC chairman Peter M. Towe.     PCIAC is a Canadian government corporation providing assistance to countries like Jordan to reduce their dependence on oil imports, Towe said.  Reuter "
grain,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.     Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed on production.     However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted.     The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said.     Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country.     Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices.     The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize.     Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.     The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.     Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change.     Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.     Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.)  Reuter "
gas,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000.     Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.     Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.     Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.  Reuter "
crude,"With troops in place in Brazil's ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force.     Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production.     The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.     The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government.     The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange.     It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.     There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports.     Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet.     A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight.     Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.     One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods.""     Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.     At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.     Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food.     The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's civilian government since it came to power two years ago.     Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates.     The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.  Reuter "

He told a general assembly of France's Oilseeds Federation (FFCOP) that a suppression of monthly increases of oilseed support prices, for example, was unacceptable.

He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position.     He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.     Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of  900 mln dlrs.     Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.     About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.     Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen.     Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said ""at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation.""

The bonuses awarded averaged 36.22 dlrs per tonne, and the wheat is scheduled for delivery during May-Oct 1987.     The bonus awards were made to Cargill, Inc (305,000 tonnes), Continental Grain Co (155,000 tonnes), Mitsubishi International Corp (60,000 tonnes) and Richco Grain Co (30,000 tonnes).

sugar,"The European Community Commission has told EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale into intervention stocks to protest against its policies, Commission sources said.     ""Our position is that we are not willing to discuss the problems of market prices at a time when traders are making threats,"" one source said.     The sources said the Commission's view was made clear at a meeting of its sugar management committee today.     They said French, West German and Dutch officials had informed the committee that traders in their countries intended to sell just over 850,000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention stocks.     The Commission riposted by signalling that it would sell the sugar sold into intervention back onto the EC market by tender, a move that would push down prices.     The sources said French traders planned to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German traders 7,500 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500.  Reuter "

About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.     Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen.     He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.     Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods.     He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.     Rha said ""I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions.""     But he added ""the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons.""     Speaking of his own country, he said ""We have made a lot of concessions already.""     He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents.     Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.     Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said ""at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation.""

grain,"The recent purchase of 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn.     With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.     South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.  Reuter "
coffee,"An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.     They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.     A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added.     By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said.     Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.   Reuter "

""Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at the expense of American farmers and dockworkers,"" Lugar said in signing on as a co-sponsor or cargo preference repeal legislation.     The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships rather than foreign vessels which are less costly.  Reuter "
grain,"Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.     Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.     Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.     As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment.     ""The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we'll get signup in,"" a USDA conservation specialist said.     Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area, he said.     Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total.     A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.     Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.  Reuter "

grain,"Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces.     Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.     Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco.     Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered.     Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate.     The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.     Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area.     Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily.     Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.     The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago.     Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather.     Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes.     Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago.     Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago.     Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest.  Reuter "

The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided that they needed more time in particular to consider a news report which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urging that the proposal be given serious consideration.

In a despatch yesterday from Washington, Reuters quoted the official as saying Manila's plan to pay some interest with notes that could be converted into equity investments in the Philippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administration strategy for handling developing country debt.     ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said.

interest,"U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.     Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said.     ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.     Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said.     ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said.     Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.     Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct.     Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added.     Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today.     Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.     ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said.     In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"" Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level.""     The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.     Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support.     ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.  Reuter "
crude,"USX Corp said proved reserves of oil and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.     The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report, indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.     USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations.     About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.     According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya.     Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.     Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves.     U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion.     In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27.     USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.     In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03 billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.     Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.     ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved market conditions for the products from these plants may make it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.     ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added.  Reuter "
trade,"House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries.     Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States.     The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.     Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties.     The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.     Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.     This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.     ""My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,"" he told reporters.     The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive.     House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.     ""I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,"" he told reporters.     The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training.     The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country's economic development.     They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief.     They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive.     The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, ""I am cautiously optimistic,"" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.  Reuter "
trade,"Soviet first deputy prime minister Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union depended on the French.     Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.     Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec.     An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment.     Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: ""It all depends on France.""     At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.     Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with ""interesting"" proposals offering latest technology and assuring ""a mutual advantage.""     He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.     He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing ""the interests of foreign partners"" in joint ventures.     But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws.     He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.     He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.     Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's food production capacity.  Reuter "
crude,"venezuela will supply ecuador with an as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export commitments, seriously affected by last week's earthquake, energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.     He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil loan agreement will be made between state oil companies petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador's cepe.     Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.      Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador's deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night.     ""the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela's,"" he said. ""we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us,"" he said.     He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days.     Venezuela's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million barrels a day, and ecuador's has been set at 210,000 bpd.  Reuter "
trade,"Britain today called on Japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.     British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.     ""I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan's domestic economy,"" he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London.     ""But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary,"" he said.     ""It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan has so massive a surplus,"" he said.     ""They may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan and the U.K.""     Channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2 billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.     But he added: ""Regrettably too much of it was in one direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling (5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them.""  Reuter "
crude,"Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake, deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.     Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.     The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.     Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments.     But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.     Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.  REUTER "

crude,"China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported.     It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.     Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.     The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.     China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered.     Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979.  REUTER "
bop,"The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.     The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment.     The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said.     Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.     It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp GM>.     GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit General Motors-Holden's Ltd>, it said.     However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier.     Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier.  REUTER "

He said more than 75 pct of the imports come from the U.S. And the rest from South Africa.

trade,"Taiwan said it would soon relax import controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and books, in a further effort to allow trading partners, especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.     Taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some 600 farm and industrial products last month, a Council for Economic Planning and Development spokesman told Reuters.     He said the new move was intended to balance trade between Taiwan and its trading partners. The island's trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985.     In January, Taiwan cut import tariffs on some 1,700 foreign products and allowed imports of U.S. Wine, beer and cigarettes.     ""We hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus this year, especially with that of the U.S.,"" the spokesman said.     Washington is pressing Taiwan to open its markets wider as a way of cutting its trade deficit with the island, which rose to 2.35 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 1.87 billion in the year-earlier period.

ship,"International efforts to redirect Japan's export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd MITH.T> (MHI), which began making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130 years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets.     ""If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products, everyone will buy them,"" MHI president Yotaro Iida said.     Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40 pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.     Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year.     ""We have made the utmost efforts among the world's manufacturers to improve productivity,"" he said. ""You may be surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers.""     Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in 1976.     Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion.     And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen.     Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct.     MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years ago.     China is the most promising market, although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers.     ""Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency,"" Iida said. But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support.     It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future.     In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport.     Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.     Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects, including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites.     It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.     MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.     Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S.     ""It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,"" Iida said.     MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage, he said.     The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support.     In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.     As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to specify which products.     ""By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on your daily products, although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business,"" he said.  REUTER "

grain,"The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.     ""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year,"" he said in a statement.     He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq.     In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.     Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB.     The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.     However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.     Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.     But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available.     In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop.     Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data.

ship,"Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms.     The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress.     President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday.     Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports.     The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports.     An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, ""The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.""     The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.     At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances.      ""Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's,"" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze.     Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that.  REUTER "
coffee,"Indonesia's coffee production in 1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.     He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may have affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how seriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.     He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it would probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks were about normal at 90,000 tonnes.     Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise much from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. ""I expect exports will be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"" he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs, but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low prices, he added.     Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target of 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds, better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

coffee,"Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.     Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.     ""But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,"" Dharyono said.     Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London.     Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.     AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise.     Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details.     ""Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,"" Muda said.     He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.     Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly.     He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.     Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed ""realistic criteria.""     The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.     Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied.     Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.     Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions.     Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.     Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.     Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said.     He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year.  REUTER "

sugar,"Hungary is to grow sugar beet on 105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said.     Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping the sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan (1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.     Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07 mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet kept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985.  REUTER "
crude,"China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported.     It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.     Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.     The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.     China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered.     Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979.  REUTER "

Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.     The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.     Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments.     But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.     Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.  REUTER "

Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acres of land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from early April to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp of America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.     American farmers would continue as working tenants and part of the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and oranges would go to the Japanese investors as rental.

trade,"Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he held ""frank"" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be settled.     Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal.     But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago.     ""It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the talks),"" Mulroney said.     Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, ""Things are running pretty quickly now.""     The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world's largest trading partnership.     But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula.     ""It's my view that we should be thinking about these things right now, along with the questions of the substance of the agreement,"" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has been highly critical of the talks in the past.     But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a ""hard and fast formula.""     Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.     Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.     A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is hoped to be presented to Congress in October.

gnp,"The worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. ""The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,"" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.     Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. ""It (the bottom) is in the offing,"" he said.     But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said.     Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing.     The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year.     Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery.     Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end.     And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.     Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels.     The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.     ""The important thing is the exchange rate,"" Taketomi said.     If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said.     A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said.     Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.     The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986.     Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.     But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.     To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.      The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said.     Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986.     Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said.     As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said.     Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good.     The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better.  REUTER "

crude,"Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said.     They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs.     Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.     The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.     They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices.     ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese refiner said.     ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added.     Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said.     They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.     The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices.     But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.     They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.     One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability.""     Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.""     He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude.     A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."" "

crude,"Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said.     They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd.     They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd.     The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said.     King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs.     ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he said.     The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.     They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.     The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said.     Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.     They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations.  REUTER "

From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.

coffee,"The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.     IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas.     ""The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,"" one Santos exporter said.     A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.     Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry.     Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year.     The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set.     With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said.     They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day.     If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.     ""The problem would be how to limit sales,"" one exporter said.     Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings.     However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.     General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.     The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks.     With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.     However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets.     Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added.

grain,"A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said.     Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.     Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.     Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings.     A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.     Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.     It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders.     Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.     ""They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,"" one trader said.     ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary.  Reuter "

Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report.     However, last month's agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added.     The banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated.     Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said.     The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added.     On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter.     The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak.

The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.     Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development ""so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.""     Hair called the department's proposal a ""reflection of a largely political decision,"" adding ""we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.""     Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough  safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.     It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration.     Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.     Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.     Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.     He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration.     The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years.     Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement.     Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.  reuter "

In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the cabinet.     Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the department's export enhancement program, Lyng said, ""No. We haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it, haven't even looked at it.""     Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, ""If they (the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept it? It would depend on what price they offered.""     Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat was far off the world price.     Asked about persistent speculation that the administration would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, ""Some people think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in the market.""     Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S. wheat subsidy offer was imminent.

crude,"Solv-Ex Corp said it successfully completed its oil sands pilot testing program under its agreement with Shell Canada Limited SHC> and received a 250,000 U.S. dlr bonus payment.     It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take over Solv-Ex's 25 pct working interest in the construction of the oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about 62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction.     It said 30 pct of that loan was guaranteed by the Government of Alberta.     In exchange for Shell's participation, Solv-Ex said Shell is obligated to pay it an up-front royalty and a running royalty based on the operating profits of the oil sands facility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil sands project will be built on Shell's oil sand lease about 40 miles north of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta.     Solv-Ex said the project will cost about 260 mln Canadian dlrs. It said that following a final feasibility study the plant should open in the early 1990s when oil prices are expected to exceed 20 U.S. dlrs per barrel.   Reuter "

crude,"Union Pacific Corp said it will enter a 50-50 partnership with Petroles de Venezuela, PDVSA, to own and operate Union Pacific's 160,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi, Texas, oil refinery.     The assests to be acquired by the partnership are valued at 190 mln dlrs, Union Pacific said.     Closing is expected to take place in early April and the venture is to be called Champlin Refining Co.     The partnership will acquire the refining and distribution systems currently owned and operated by Champlin Petroleum, a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Pacific.     The venture will acquire the related inventories and the Champlin trade name, the company said.     PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and receivables, Union Pacific said.     Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25-year agreement to supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha to the refinery at market related prices.     Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could supply another 50,000 bpd on similar terms, the company said.     ""This will provide a stable, long-term supply to the refinery at competitive costs, thereby assuring the economic viability of the plant,"" a statement issued by Union Pacific said.    The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the company to supply a steady flow of refined products to its customers.    Union Pacific said employees of the refinery would be transfered to the new company and would retain the same benefits as in the past.  Reuter "
grain,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.     ""It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it,"" Lyng said in an interview with Reuters.     ""It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing,"" he said.     However, Lyng said he did not want to make a ""definitive commitment one way or another at this point.""     Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat.     Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.     Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow would buy this year.     ""I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets,"" he said. ""I have no knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the Soviets have any knowledge.""     Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last month because ""they needed it and because the price was right.""     ""Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think they've always found that our corn was good,"" he said.  Reuter "

oilseed,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.     Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, ""I don't think so. I don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway.""     However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan.     ""I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans,"" he said.

gold,"The new British one ounce gold coin, the ""Britannia,"" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a ""competitive premium,"" Treasury officials said.     Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.     Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the South African krugerrand, the British government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.     Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.     No details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.     There were some enquiries on the ""Britannia"" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said.     Some said that the ""Britannia"" had come too late, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins already well established.  Reuter "
crude,"Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March 28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.     Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.     Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.      Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the  shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.     Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said.     The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.     In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said.     Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.     Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks.     As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April.  Reuter "

""It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza,"" he told reporters.     He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.     Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details.     Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage, the overall situation had improved compared with last December when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks.     Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels of crude.  Reuter "

grain,"Implementation of a one-year 0/92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions.     ""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.""     Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week.     Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under the current bill.     It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill, he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.     A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.     Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point, he said.     ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman said at the hearing.     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.     Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.     ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but we can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said.     Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers' dependency on the government, he said.     A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.     Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.     But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

""The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been reversed,"" Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here.     However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs, particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year, achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.     Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debt.     He said the process of restoring external balance to the U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of financial and real resources into internationally competitive industry. ""More of our growth will need to be reflected in net exports and business investment and less in consumption,"" Volcker said.  Reuter "
grain,"The use of generic in-kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive for the world's largest grain company said.     Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading.     ""The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade,"" he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels.     Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.     Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program, he said.     ""The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand,"" he said.     Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his committee would be looking at the certificate program later this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on certificate costs.

Oil imports peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said.

gnp,"Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said.      Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month.      He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.     Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full.     Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added.     Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time.      Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates.     Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months.      He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer.     He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added.     ""We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,"" Nogales said. ""Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all.""     ""The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,"" he added.     Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club.      He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added.      He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.     He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year.     The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.     Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985.     Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government's first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level.     He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates.  Reuter "
grain,"A marketing loan for U.S. wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said.     ""I think I would not support a marketing loan now,"" he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.     A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly, he said.

trade,"The House Ways and Means Trade  Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods.     The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said.     ""This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism',"" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.     The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.     But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.     Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries.      The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls, incentives for research, expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.     The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees.     It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries.     The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products.     It extends until January 1993, the administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.     And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods.  Reuter "

""A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern, both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve,"" he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders here.     He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.     He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.     ""Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy,"" the Fed chairman said.

In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite having reached a rescheduling accord on its own.     In the 90-minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up the achievements of his administration, which took office in february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in non-oil gdp in 1986 and to a ""moderate"" 12 pct inflation rate.

In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to achieve 'the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of development and the (financing) of trade and investment.'     Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported components of new development projects.     ""our intention is not to continue being net exporters of capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of capital towards venezuela,"" he said.     Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor.

crude,"Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.     Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month.     The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil.     But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment.     Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.     ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said.     Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said.     Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are ""reasonably balanced.""      Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.

trade,"The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods.     The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said.     ""This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism',"" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.     The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.

coffee,"Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said.     Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.     ""In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy,"" he said.     Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.     Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term.     ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986.     Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume.     ""Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers,"" he said.     He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, ""because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market.""     Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30.     Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.     ""There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future,"" he told journalists.     Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.     Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved.     Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear.     He said Brazil's current quota ""reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,"" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it.     Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen.

crude,"Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.     He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August.     Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.     Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action.     Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.     Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.     The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.

gnp,"Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets.     Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth.     By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.     Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments.     He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely.     Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988.     Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.""     He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, ""It looks like they're on track.""     While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.     The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said.     ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.""     Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit.     In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.     Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.     ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said.     ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added.     However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.     ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,"" he said.     Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread distrust of government.     ""The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,"" Penner said.     ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.""     Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.     He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed.     ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said.     Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets.     ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said.  REUTER "

sugar,"China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said.     He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details.     One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.     ""It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,"" he said.     Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.     The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.     The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.     ""In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,"" it said.     ""The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,"" it added.     It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them.     The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.     Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.     In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.     The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills.     A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985.     He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.     But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.     He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.     A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. ""Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"" he said.     ""China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,"" he said.     The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988.     He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.     ""Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,"" he said.     He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.  REUTER "

Under an agreement with the U.S. And Australia, Japan has been increasing imports by 9,000 tonnes a year from March 31, 1985, to reach a projected 177,000 tonnes in the year to March 31, 1988.

Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to 480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.     It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast.     Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said.     The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year, it said.     The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year.     It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.     The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar, the AMLC said.     It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively around 94 pct of total Australian exports.  REUTER "

Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against capacity of about six mln CGRT.     The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.     The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.     The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to stick to them.

Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment.     The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added.

ship,"Employers in Rotterdam port's strike-hit general cargo sector have been served with an injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with plans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers' organisation spokesman said.     An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal fault in the employers' redundancy procedure.     The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restart the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to pre-empt the May 7 final court ruling.     Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was resolved.     Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's 4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this year.     The employers said there were no immediate plans for meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or on a new work practice agreement in the sector.     Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the port's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated, although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector, the employers' spokesman added.

The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdam court preventing the sector's employers continuing with current plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again on May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo sector's 4,000 workers today.     The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed.     ""There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted,"" Rosenmuller said.     But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves to re-apply for permission for the redundancies.     SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applying for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval for the redundancies within a month.

coffee,"Long delays at the railway crossing on the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffee exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.     Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.     Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways official said. ""Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu,"" he said.     However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing bottlenecks on the lake route too.     Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported delays in coffee export shipments last January due to congestion on the lake ferries.     Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's export earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid the higher costs of road haulage.

At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore, with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find, discovered on Wednesday, was worth.     However, mining could only begin after foreign partners invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the spokesman said.     The Haitian government has never before operated a gold mine, but the United Nations has recently completed a three year feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa as sites of important gold deposits.     In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a Canadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate containing gold as well as copper.     ""The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,"" said a former official of Sedren Mine.     ""But like everything else there's a catch. The gold has to be extracted, and first someone has to come up with the money to finance the operation,"" the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.  Reuter "

The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials.

sugar,"Cuban sugar export figures for January suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.     Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization.     January is the first major export month and the figures thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said. Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000 tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking at the end of 1985, they added.     Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this year at 7.50 mln tonnes.     Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.     There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.     Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.     Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar.     Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was 237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.

The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said.     Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.     However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added.  Reuter "
grain,"The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.     Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official.     In a report dated March 10, the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.     An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.     Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.     Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said.     The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year, he said.  Reuter "
interest,"U.S. February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.     ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.     ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation front, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well under control. It's an absolutely ideal situation.""     February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected. This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.     The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct, less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January.     ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.""     The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.     ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.""     In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI.     Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected, but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.     Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.     ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.     While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar.     ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" he said. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers.""     Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.     If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.     By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.     Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar.     David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output.     ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said. ""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output.""     Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter. ""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive.""     But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not  convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output.     Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production.     Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.     Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units.     ""In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate,"" Roach said. ""The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories.""     Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987.     January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the largest monthly sales drop on record.     Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes. ""The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months,"" Ramirez said. ""They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months.""  Reuter "

""Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,"" Murray said.     Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985.     Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts ""the company has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and Indonesia.     Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring of its domestic exploration and development organization and this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which support the new affiliate.     ""Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our assets,"" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.     Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which will combine its current three exploration and producing affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present organization and will improve the company's upstream competitive position.     Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance the development and transfer of technology supporting critical areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and computer systems.     Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827 mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs in earnings.     Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities with the greatest long term potential, the company said.     In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include greater emphasis on ""frontier plays that, although riskier, fit our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective overseas exploration offers greater potential.""

crude,"Brazil's labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three days ago.     The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal.     A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country's main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.     A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.     Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.     Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.     Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike.     The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday.     Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.     Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.     On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.     Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana.     The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance.     On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks.

They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's Pacific Ocean coast.     The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.     The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said.     The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand.     The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an  earthquake the night before.     The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean.     Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake.

grain,"A greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said.     As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.     First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.     A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.     Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.     Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.     ""Significant downside potential"" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.     ""If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period,"" he said.     Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying.     U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said.     ""This price difference makes American corn competitive,"" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters.     Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.     Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.     In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.  Reuter "
coffee,"Colombia opened coffee export registrations for April and May with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no limit, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association, said.

grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department has accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.     In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.     The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.     Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover.     Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn ""bonus"" rental payment that was offered by USDA.     The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve.     The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and Kansas with 842,000 acres.     Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with 646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska with 554,000 acres.     In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000 acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled.     Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program totals 19,488,587 acres.

trade,"The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.     The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.     The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.     The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved.      In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties.      The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers.      President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991.     The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.     It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991.     Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years.     Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports.  Reuter "
grain,"U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact.     ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said.     The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.     Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31.     Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.     Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing,"" he added.     The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures.     Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures.     Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitely looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than expected.""     The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve.     Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures.     ""I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the long run,"" she said.     Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition.     ""It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program,"" she said.     Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's.     Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres.     New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program, despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures.

crude,"Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.     Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.     Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.      Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five  months.     Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.     Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).     Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd.  Reuter "

interest,"U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.     ""People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything,"" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains.     The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. ""We've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates,"" Mains said.     The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for ""less than ebullient market action,"" Mains said.     He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range.     ""My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified,"" Mains said.     Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest. ""All of the movement occurs at the opening,"" afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.     Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were ""not real exciting,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner.     ""There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment,"" Leiner said.     Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month.     Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979.     ""The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal,"" Kahan said.     He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth.     If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.  Reuter "
coffee,"A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association, told Reuters.     Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no limit.     Since the start of the coffee year last october, private exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per month.     ""Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top,"" Arango said in an interview.     ""Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away,"" he added.     Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including a lower export registration price, as a major change in Colombia's coffee marketing policy.     The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).     The government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market.     A frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said.  Reuter "

Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.     The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.     The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday.

crude,"Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it.     Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota.     Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said.     The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.     Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.""     Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.     ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,"" he said.     OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.     Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.     Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.     ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,"" he said.     Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said.     King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.     ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,"" he said.     Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.     Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.     ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.     Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.     But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.""     Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer.     Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.     ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,"" Nazer said.     He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit.  REUTER "

The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners.     The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax.     They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs.     It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.     The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway.     The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.     Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected.     But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.     The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports.     The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.  REUTER "
crude,"Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy.     The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.     The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.     Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.     Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance.     Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.     The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.     Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.     With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves.     The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community.     Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans.     But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: ""Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.""     Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting.     Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: ""While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.""     It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here.     Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985.     Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.     Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.     Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.     The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt.     Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom.     A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.

sugar,"Taiwan is not expected to export sugar this year because of falling production and growing domestic consumption, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said.     A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar. Last year, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes.     He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season (November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet local consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of 570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage to more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year.  REUTER "
grain,"Tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumper harvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday.     The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it.     The state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country.     NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania.     In addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage capacity, he added.     Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos in the main maize producing areas of Iringa, Mbeya, Ruvuma and Rukwa.  REUTER "
bop,"Australia's current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion, market economists polled by Reuters said.     Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.     The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January, after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs.     As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.     A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said.     Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments, they said.     They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.

sugar,"European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.     A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.     Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht.     Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons.     Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called ""C"" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC ""A"" and ""B"" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively.     Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output.     Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.     However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic ""A"" and ""B"" quotas, they added.     In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.     ""The basic trend is towards stability,"" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.     In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.     Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.     British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.     British Sugar has ""A"" and ""B"" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its ""C"" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types.     Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level.     The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.     World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya.     Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.     Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said.     The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of ""C"" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined ""A"" and ""B"" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.     ""The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of ""C"" sugar really worthwhile,"" the spokesman said.     Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.     Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand.     The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.     A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.     In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.     Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.

He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986.     Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details.     He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly. ""In particular, short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct,"" he said.     Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.     He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform.     Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.     Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors.

crude,"OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.     A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.     MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.     MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage.     Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.     The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that.     It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of ""purchase crude.""     It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices.     MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members.     The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices.     The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and ""other forms of hydrocarbons"" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil.

Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed the central banks' limits and real growth of their gross national products, it said.     Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said.     Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen. These factors and South Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underline the firmer sentiment, it said.

crude,"President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.     Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt.     ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.""     Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.     He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.     Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.

crude,"Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.     But the French bank's plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate.     The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.     President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.     Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.     Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said.     The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in August 1982.     Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back.     ""There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad,"" one banker commented.  Reuter "
crude,"Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it.     Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota.     Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said.     The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.     Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.""     Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.     ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,"" he said.     OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.     Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.     Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.     ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,"" he said.     Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said.     King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.     ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,"" he said.     Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.     Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.     ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.     Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.     But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.""     Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer.     Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.     ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,"" Nazer said.     He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. "
trade,"Turkey's trade deficit rose to 3.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from 3.39 billion in 1985 following increased imports from Western countries, figures from the State Statistics Institute show.     Exports were down 6.3 pct at 7.45 billion dlrs, compared with 7.95 billion in 1985, while imports were down 2.1 pct at 11.10 billion dlrs from 11.34 billion.     Total trade with Mid-East Gulf states fell some 40 pct due to lower oil prices, with imports at 1.55 billion dlrs, compared with 2.74 billion, and exports at 1.65 billion after 2.72 billion.     Exports to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries rose to 4.29 billion dlrs from 4.11 billion in 1985, while imports were 4.56 billion after 3.55 billion.

trade,"Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.     One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year repayment term.     Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.     Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.     One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.     The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.     Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992.     Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware, the officials said.     An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.     Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977 when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing ally and turned to the U.S..  REUTER "
crude,"Saudi Arabia has dropped its condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, state-oil company Petrobras said in a statement.     Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees.     Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks.     Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers.     The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled.     The shipment was part of a contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June.  REUTER "
trade,"Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.     At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.     West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.     They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis.     Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.     Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said.     Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations.     The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body GATT.     But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added.     Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.     Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added.  REUTER "
trade,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war.     ""The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I've ever seen it in six years in Washington,"" Baldrige said in a weekend television interview.     ""I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration, but there is a hardening trade attitude,"" he said.     President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation.     However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalize trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill.     When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war, Baldrige said: ""Yes, I don't think there's any question about that.""  Reuter "
cpi,"A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy.     But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain.     Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out.     The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year.     France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts.     For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch ""a veritable intellectual revolution"" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control.     ""The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,"" Develle said.     But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage.     ""The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological"" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. ""Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.""     Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors.     Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan.     Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December.     At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.     The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less.     ""But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,"" commented Develle of Paribas.     Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985.     But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power.     A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted.     Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were ""increasingly ill-adapted to demand"" and over-priced, the report said.     French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. ""One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,"" he said.     And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.     The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.     French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

gold,"Gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.     It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.     Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed central bank limits and real growth of their gross national products, it added.     Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said.     Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.     These factors and South Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it said.     However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.  Reuter "

Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.

But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to alter the 1987 crop program. Sign-up for spring crops closes the end of this month.

trade,"West German exports to the United States fell below four billion marks worth in January for the first time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed.     The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks in January, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and the lowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S. In July 1984. This compared with 4.86 billion marks in January 1986.     Total West German exports to Western industrialised countries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks from December's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly total since July 1984.     West German exports to the European Community were 21.60 billion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in December and 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.     Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned economies also slackened.     Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.     This was one of the strengths of West German exports compared with Japan, which depended in large part on the U.S., OPEC and developing country markets, it added.  REUTER "
trade,"U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April.     In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.     This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.     Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products.      On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.     Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's bill was not one ""that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"" but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.     Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, ""to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't avoided violating agreements.""     In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.     It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy.     Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.     Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.     As an indication of his success, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions. But he added, ""Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.""     The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States.     The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation.     Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.     Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress.     But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.""     In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.     Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.     House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition.     Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.     For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production.     It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981.  Reuter "

After January's rise the government was forced to revise its inflation target for 1987 to 2.5 pct year on year from an initial target of two pct, after 2.1 pct in 1986.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February slowing.  REUTER "
oilseed,"American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said.     Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch.     After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.     ""Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"" he said.     ""The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,"" Bennett added.     Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said.     The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.     U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said.     The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added.     The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.     ""We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures,"" Bennett said.     ""The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist, and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"" he added.  Reuter "

gnp,"The Belgian government has lowered its forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in 1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.     He said this revision, which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions, takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade.     But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be limited due to recent agreements on wages and working conditions agreed by employers and unions.     Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms.

trade,"Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system.     Speaking to a business conference he said ""It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries.""     ""The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds,"" he added.     Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe and Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he stressed the country's commitment to growth.     ""We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing,"" he said, adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.     Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world, has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems.     President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem.     ""We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis.""     To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this year's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5 billion.     Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year.

grain,"A 0/92 program would have very little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the Agriculture Department.     The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.     The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.     ""The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small,"" the report said.     ""The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage,"" the USDA report said.     The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production/high risk areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins, director of USDA's economics analysis staff.     ""In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation,"" Collins said.     USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.     Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of cotton, the report said.     ""In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered,"" according to the analysis.     ""What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production,"" Collins said.     For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more attractive.     Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.     ""I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments,"" Collins said.     In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.

coffee,"Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions.     Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas.     ""Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,"" he said.     Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.     Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.     ""This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new,"" he said.     The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends.     Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount.     But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee.     ""Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.""     Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said.     ""We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is,"" he said.     Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.     Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was ""ridiculous.""     He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.     On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise.     Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them.     However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy.     ""Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.""     Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.  Reuter "
gnp,"Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.     He said this will enable the requirement to be held to 419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of 417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.     Martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the target by 22.5 billion francs.     Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion. The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations.     Martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's 50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.     Last year, the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.     The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the government said was a ""snowball effect"" under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt.     In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.  REUTER "

Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons, Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries.     Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, ""a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging.""   In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost.     ""Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades, we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising, one that is under-developed and under-employed,"" said Mulroney.     ""What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity.""     Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners.     Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.     It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes, something that would give Canada protection from Washington's tough trade remedy laws.     But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S, said Canada was a ""fair trader"" and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market.     He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.     ""We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is fair to both sides,"" Mulroney said.  Reuter "

cpi,"Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he was maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in retail prices for February.     He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.     He said he was happy with ""a good result"" for February but stressed a need for continued ""vigilance"" against inflation.     A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year differential between French and lower West German inflation rates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.

trade,"Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.     The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.     ""The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,"" Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.     Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October.     Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea.     Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final port at the start of a voyage.     Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.     Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     ""Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.     ""Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.     ""No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa, but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government,"" he said.     The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.     Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries.     Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found.     The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  Reuter "

bop,"Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.     Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.     ""This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,"" Simonsen said in a statement.     ""The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,"" he added.     ""Standard  Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.     ""If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,"" Simonsen said.    Standard and Poor's said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt.     The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics.     Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.

trade,"U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April.     In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.     The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.     Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws.     The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.     In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.     Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products.     But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.     Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one ""that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.     The goal of trade legislation was ""to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,"" he said.     In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.     It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy.     Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.     Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, ""Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.""     The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.     The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation.     Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.     AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress.     But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.""     Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.     House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

trade,"Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy, Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.     Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.     Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries' terms of trade ""the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken,"" Tesfay said.    The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West.     Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements.     The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean ""several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items,"" he said.     Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country's foreign exchange earnings.     Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.     He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors.     Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.     He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa's economic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.     The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.     Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs, with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped.    In view of this poor response, he said ""it is possible that by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few, will be categorised as least developed countries.""     At present, 27 of Africa's 50-odd states are officially listed in this category.  REUTER "

The department said the sales will be subsidized with commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete at commercial prices in the Algerian market.     Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced November 10, 1986, it said.

crude,"The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.     In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value.     Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.     The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.      The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.     The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.   Reuter "
trade,"The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.     The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below the same month last year.     Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.     Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs.     Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.     Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth.     Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil.     In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period.     This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government's program for economic growth, Fendt added.  Reuter "

soybean,"A high-level meeting last week which included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told Reuters.     ""We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close the door on anything,"" a member of the soybean delegation said.     At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn.     But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.     Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but participants would not reveal what those options were.     ""There were no surprises in our package,"" one participant said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates.     The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.     This would have the effect of lowering the world price, maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government's soybean inventory.     A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last week's meeting, participants said.     One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a ""listening session"" for USDA, and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department.     USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future.     ""USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could influence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,"" a participant said.  Reuter "
trade,"Farm subsidies and protectionist moves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic, Michael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, warned.     ""It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between Europe and the United States,"" Jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech.     ""But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks,"" he said.     ""Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies.     ""And above all, Europe and the United States have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one."" He added, ""It is crucial that the United States and the European Community remain friends.""     Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee, was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S. officials in Washington later this week.     Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.     He said his government would oppose such a move because ""We do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support (EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer's expense.""

EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for greater effort by the country to open its markets.     Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves.     EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has already written to his U.S. counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns.     The ministers' said they were ""very disturbed"" by the U.S. moves, adding, ""the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations.""     Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said.     In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.""     The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand.     Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary.     One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It wil be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said.     De Clercq told journalists, ""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan.""

oilseed,"The European Community's (EC) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.     Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.     But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's budget.     He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. ""I hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget,"" he said.     The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said.     Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.     The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils.     Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax.     ""What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home,"" he said.     Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other countries.     Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.     The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.     In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.     Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission's farm price proposals, he added.    Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition.     The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.     National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production.     Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today's vote.

February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus against a 246 mln shortfall (revised from 287 mln) in January and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986.     The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by market economists yesterday.     February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from 2.74 billion (revised from 2.72 billion) in January and 2.54 billion a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2.77 billion from 2.99 billion (revised from 3.01 billion) against 2.70 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11 pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pct rise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels.     On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pct in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, the Bureau said.     The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253 mln (revised from 268 mln) in January and 192 mln a year earlier, the Bureau said.     This made a sharply lower deficit of 104 mln dlrs on the balance of goods and services against deficits of 499 mln in January and 354 mln a year earlier.     Deficit on net income and unrequited transfers was 646 mln dlrs against 736 mln in January and 543 mln a year earlier.

""We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,"" Buttrose said.     Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added ""Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets).""

crude,"A government study has concluded the U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability, the New York Times said.     The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.     The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.     The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.     It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels.     The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.    The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers.     ""The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,"" it added.

grain,"China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters.     They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.     An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.     Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.     ""China is short of foreign exchange,"" the Shanghai official said. ""We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer.""     A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption.     ""At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs,"" the trader said.     The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level.     The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.     ""All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,"" it said.     It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought.     Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low.     Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output.     The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers.     Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.     Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province.     ""In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,"" he said.     The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers.     The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable.     ""The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm,"" it said.  REUTER "

The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been put at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2 pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September.     In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7 pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst since 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed the strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry.     In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/December quarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase in the previous three months, the Agency said.     Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December, after a one pct rise the previous quarter.     Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to real GNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2. The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding.     In July/September, domestic demand contributed one percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off 0.3 point.

They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers.     South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991.     South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45 billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.     The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.     The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan.     The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit.  REUTER "
livestock,"The Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been set yet, industry sources said.     Production prices, the basis for setting intervention prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said.     Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values, the sources added.     In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers.     The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market.     The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is 1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.     The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760.     They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market.     Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices, they said.

The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln tonnes and forecast little change for 1987.     Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks.     Affandi told reporters stocks fel to as low as 159,000 tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this represented under one month's consumption.

corn,"Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65 pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural industry sources said.     They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.     Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe.     While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000 tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes, which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.     The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from 248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

This contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.     The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined 12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing production increased 1.4 pct.     The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to 8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no growth in real output during 1986.

trade,"Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case.     ""We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact,"" Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.     ""The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place,"" he said.     U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.     The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market.     The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.     Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries.     MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said.     ""The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,"" Honda said.     MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added.     The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.     Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. ""I am optimistic,"" he added.  REUTER "
ship,"Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.     The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.     Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.     Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  REUTER "

ship,"Employers in Rotterdam's troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.     Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector.     The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers' plans for 350 redundancies this year.     A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7.     Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case.     ""We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business, and further delays would do even more damage,"" Zeebregts said.     The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general cargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce by 1990, starting with 350 this year.

gnp,"The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said.     Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said.     They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years.     The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter.     It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis.     They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales.     But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off.     ""Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,"" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.     He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of  falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise.     Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.     Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins.     ""This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,"" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.     Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending.     Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax.  REUTER "

EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already distanced itself from the bill.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns.     The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S. Moves towards protectionism. ""The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral relations,"" it said.     Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it said.     In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.""     The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.     Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary.     One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It will be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said.     De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said, ""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan.""     But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research.

livestock,"Livestock analysts expect renewed bull spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA 7-state cattle on feed report.     The USDA reported high placements in February, which may weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued strong marketings during the month will support the April contract.     Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50 cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts said.     Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom O'Hare. ""They have no place to send the grain,"" he said.     Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.     ""The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,"" said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that even though placements came in above the average trade guess, many traders had expected high placements.     Placements are not that negative, especially since the technical correction in June and August live cattle futures since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.     He said the current marketing posture will provide added support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been running at a heavier than expected pace.     Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.     ""So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They (feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish development,"" Levitt said.     Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.  Reuter "

Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit was 36.28 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57 billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.     The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from 37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit.     Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.     The current account includes trade in merchandise and services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest of the world.     The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986, compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.

For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.     Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter.     Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs, surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.    Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr third-quarter increase.     U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.     Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7 billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Foreign direct investment in the United States increased 14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6 billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up acquisitions, the department said.     Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800 mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4 billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said.

Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The Hague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over steel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.     ""I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus ill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation,"" he said. ""I feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.""     Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get the American balance of payments into better shape, but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering noted.     ""If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war, then I think the answer is probably yes,"" he said.     In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the EC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports, the Treasury said.     The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July, 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries.     It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries, the Treasury said.

trade,"The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called ""mixed credits,"" the OECD said.     The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations.     Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said.     Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year.     The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.     OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.     By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use.

Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.     On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88.     No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. ""But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,"" the Chancellor told Parliament.     Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 ""is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.""     On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987.     He said ""it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.""     Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future.     ""We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,"" Lawson said.     ""Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.""     ""But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.""     Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book.     On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the ""appropriate corporation tax rate.""     He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains.     ""Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,"" Lawson said.     Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, ""with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.""     ""I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.""     This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s.     Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred.     Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field.     On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers.     Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received.     Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg.     New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.     The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg.     Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but ""genuine trading companies"" will not be affected.     He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1.     ""In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,"" he said.     The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.     Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added ""given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.""     Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said.     On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders.     The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.     ""The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,"" Lawson said.  MORE "
grain,"U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains producers.     Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.     He also said his bill would protect program participants from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose above the loan rate.  Reuter "

""It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota restraint, will boost the price of oil,"" Margoshes said.     Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes said he recommends Imperial Oil IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8, Standard Oil Co SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon XON> one to 83-1/8, and Chevron CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.     In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic Richfield ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose 1-3/4 to 77.     He said ""the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher oil prices.""     He noted that belief that the government is interested in raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil stocks today.

gnp,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987.     He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87, Lawson said.     Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate.     The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.

crude,"Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil company, said in a published interview today that it was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close on of its french refineries.     Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France during the interview.     An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of Exxon's opertations were under constant review.     Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.     Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.     Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the improvement in the European refining situation, its future profits there should be good.     ""Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior earnings,"" Mlotok said.     ""Just after Royal Dutch RD>, they are seen as one of the highest grade refiners in Europe,"" he added.     Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as these producers move further into downstream operations.     PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export refineries.     PIW said ""sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last year.""  Reuter "
grain,"A proposal by two U.S. House Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today.     ""On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen,"" said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. ""This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal.""     The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.     The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.     Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years, protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted.     However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would ""involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is.""     Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.     Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments.  Reuter "

crude,"Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement.     Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).     To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said.     The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.     Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability.     This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said.     This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said.     In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated.     The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.     These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation.     Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called ""ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.     Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.     He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.     Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said.     Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.     He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.     This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.     He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year.  REUTER "
interest,"British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.     The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward.     Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said.     Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.     ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,"" he said.     Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now.     Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.     ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said.     Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. ""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said.     National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.     Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented.  But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said.     Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.     U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets.     But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.  REUTER "
dlr,"The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said.     Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies ""can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective.""     He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald ""an era of greater exchange rate stability.""     The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level.     ""At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen,"" Gleske said.     He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary.     But ""a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value,"" he said.    In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said.     First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses.     Second, in the United States, it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske said.     Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, ""both within countries and between them.""     For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.     If target zones were established, this would put ""pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more, even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities,"" he said.     Gleske added, ""targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities.""     Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained.     These chances ""seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates, and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead.""     Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned ""that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot."" He said this ""would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible.""     Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments, he said.  REUTER "

grain,"Light, scattered showers covered winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy in most central and northern areas, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.     In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative stage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North China Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the south.      Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui, eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed February's below normal precipitation pattern.     The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for irrigation.

crude,"A White House-ordered report said  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security.     The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy.  reuter "
crude,"an eventual oil import fee in the united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum corp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.     ""this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all eventualities in this regard,"" he told reuters during the signing ceremony here.     Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as ""one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets.""    union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.     ""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides,"" he said.     Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield.     ""therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact on today's agreement,"" adams said.     He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins.     The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct yield of white products.  Reuter "

grain,"Dry weather pushed further into South Africa's Orange Free State's Maize Triangle in the week ended March 14, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.     In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal, but dry pockets persisted in the northeast and south.     Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said.     The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State.

grain,"Dry weather covered most European crop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those in southwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.     In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency said mixed rain and snow covered Greece.     Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.     Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in early April, it said.     Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.     Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by late April.     Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India, reversing February's below-normal trend.     Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most southern areas, it said.     In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon and southern Mindanao.     Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.     In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding in Java, it said.     The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.     Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in Southeast Asia.     Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet crop demands, it said.     Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained adequate moisture for crop growth, it said.     Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase, the agency said.  Reuter "
interest,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.     A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.     ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget.""     Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.     Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.     As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment"" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct.     The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.     Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow.     ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.     The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.     Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.     ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"" he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation.     The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said     Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation.     Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the ""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front.     He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness.     Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.     Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg.     But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988.     Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.     But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it.     James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost.""     Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.     Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.  REUTER "
crude,"Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.     He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day.     The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day.     Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints.     Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce.     He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.     Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy.     He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day.     The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat.  Reuter "

crude,"A White House-ordered report said  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security.     The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy.     The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.  Reuter "
crude,"OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.     In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: ""OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.""     But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases.     ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production,"" Al-Wattari said.     ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.     Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices.     The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added.     He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.     But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation,"" he said.     Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.     Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.     Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.  Reuter "

crude,"Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) official said.     ""We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected,"" he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today.     He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.     He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.     Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd.     He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil.  Reuter "
crude,"The U.K. Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86.     The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.     The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels, the Treasury document said.     The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag.     The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full year.     Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987, according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.     Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts, despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.     Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot.     Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items, besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of 40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.     Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion, compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year.     The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year.     A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in 1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury said.

grain,"The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant.     The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.     Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.     USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs.     The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received.     To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay.     USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.     The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding.     In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall.     Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.     The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance.     USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings.     USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs.     USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs.     In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.     But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program.  Reuter "

grain,"From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August, 1987.     These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.     Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said.     The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise.     The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said.     The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.     During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.     The department said the President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs.     In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86, it said.     Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said.  Reuter "

Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.     Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under consideration, VonGarlem said.

A grain industry representative said some participants were ""puzzled"" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.

interest,"Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said.     They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market.     Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said.     Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the sources said.     Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.     Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.     Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits.     Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.     The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.     Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.     Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital.     If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.     Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market.  REUTER "

interest,"New Zealand's inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.     The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December.     Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.     The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.     The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to change, it said.     Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in calendar 1986, it said.     ""Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls away,"" the NZIER said.     Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.     Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.     The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.     ""A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast,"" the NZIER said. ""The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in 1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.""     The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32 billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and 3.33 billion in 1985/86.     The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87 billion in 1985/86.     This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.     ""Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation ...,"" the NZIER said.

That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the fourth quarter of 1985.     The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of 1986 over 1985.     The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the department said.     The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter.

crude,"Malaysia's state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said.     Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.     Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.     However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987.     The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said.     Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.     Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output.     The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.     In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said.     However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. "

interest,"West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the usual interim period.     A Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG DRSD.F> and Commerzbank AG CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.     The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks.     A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said.     But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said.     He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate.     The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct.     Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline.  REUTER "

interest,"Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.     They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.     Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg.     Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.     Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.     But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.     Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.     ""Today's cut was slightly disappointing,"" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. ""The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.""     Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time.     The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term.     Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.     ""The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being,"" said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. ""But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long.""     Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.     Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said ""There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.""     Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate.     Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.     Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets.     With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said ""Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.""

ship,"Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.     The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.     The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.     The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.     They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.     Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.     The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said.     A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said.     Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.     This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.     The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.     The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989.     Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping.     However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said.     Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.     The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said.     In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.     ""World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,"" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.     The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.  REUTER "

grain,"Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.     Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.     By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed.     If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis.     ""The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices,"" one dealer said. ""It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,"" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest.     ""But we don't know when they might do it,"" an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market.     The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage.     Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date been exchanged for grain.     With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.     A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said.     Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.     The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said.     ""The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"" which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said.     But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.  Reuter "
gnp,"The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.     The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.     The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year.      The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1.5 pct.     Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.     In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak.     DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.     It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.     Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand, it said.     In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall markedly this year.     However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986, it said.

trade,"Peru registered a 16 mln dlr trade deficit in 1986, its first trade shortfall in four years, a central bank statement said.     The figure compared with a surpluses of 1.17 billion dlrs in 1985, 1.01 billion in 1984 and 293 mln in 1983. The last trade deficit was a 428 mln shortfall in 1982.     Peru's exports fell to 2.51 billion dlrs last year from 2.98 billion in 1985. Last year's imports were 2.53 billion dlrs against 1.81 billion dlrs in 1985.  REUTER "
crude,"The White House said a proposal for a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review.     Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil industry.     But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks.     He said that even though Herrington's recommendation did not agree with existing policy, ""We'll take a look at it.""     The review will be undertaken by the president's Domestic Policy Council.     Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security.

crude,"Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration.     ""These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. ""It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.""     He said proposals, including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax, should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.     ""The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year.""     The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports.     ""We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995,"" Herrington said.     He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes.     ""Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been favored by the administration. I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration,"" he said.     He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.     Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance.     Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost.

crude,"The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts said.     Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by 1990, some analysts said.     The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of the nation's largest gas reserves are located.     ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" said James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they're betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two.""     The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages.     The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co HT> rig count, a barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.     In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.     Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won't be any better this year.""     He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil. Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost.""     Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.     George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.     ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988,"" Gaspar said.     Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.     Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon Corp XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.     For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont DD> subsidiary, will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day.     But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership MLP> in recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery.     Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.     ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.     Tenneco Inc TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers, is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.     Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.  Reuter "
sugar,"Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said.     Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S. Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.     The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA), told Reuters.     However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output.     ""Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable,"" he said.     Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.     ""The prices are ridiculous,"" said Julian Mateo, vice president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League. ""At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.""     Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets.     An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets. ""The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.""     In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000 more, according to the London-based International Sugar Organization.     Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover.     Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply.     Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from 900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added.     Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.     Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985.     The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels.     Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market.     Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37,000.     A national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru's production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.     At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre, ""grows like a weed"" throughout the region.     Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.     The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.     Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace.     Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles.     However, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.     Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.     ""The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries,"" Brazil's Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting.     The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices.     GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact.     ""They have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,"" GEPLACEA's Latorre said.  Reuter "
gold,"Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York plans an issue of 12,000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs an ounce, lead manager Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG said.     Each warrant, priced at 955 Swiss francs, entitled holders to acquire five-ounce bars of .999 gold in the period from April 30, 1987, to July 31, 1991, exercisable on Wednesdays.     The warrants represented unsecured, unsubordinated liabilities of the borrower. Payment was due April 16, and a quotation on the Luxembourg bourse was planned.     The warrants, when exercised, would be repaid in current dollars based on the value of gold on the exercise date.     The conditions represent a premium of about 145 dlrs an ounce to the current gold price.     A Morgan (Switzerland) official said that on the basis of the maturity of four years and three months, the pricing involved an implicit volatility of gold of 24.5 pct before the warrants were in the money, compared with implicit volatility of 30 pct for the Indosuez gold warrants and 26 pct for the Citibank gold warrants recent issued with maturities of 18 and 24 months.

trade,"The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners.     The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.     A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.     Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.     But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices.     Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.     He said ""If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.""     Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying ""in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.""     Otherwise, he said, ""the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.""     Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims.     Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.     ""Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,"" he said.     House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.     There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.      Reuter "
grain,"The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.     Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.     Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.     Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget, Glickman added.     Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.     ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in the water,"" he said.     To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.     Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending.     Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.     Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said.     While not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.     Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.     He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change.     Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's, EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas.     Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.     ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block,"" Glickman said.  Reuter "
crude,"The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today.      The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out.      ""The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year),"" Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent told Reuters.      ""It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,"" he added, ""and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again.""      The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel.      At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help.      Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985.      Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East.      ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp XON>, the nation's largest oil company.      At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.""      Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.""      He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry.""      Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund"" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.      Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised.      In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world's total oil consumption by that date.      Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of Pitts Oil Co>, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised.""      Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a ""shambles.""      Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. ""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over,"" he said.      Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,"" adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by midyear.""

crude,"New England Electric System NES> expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting.     It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.     The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.     The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.     New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987.     The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.     New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well.     The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.     President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.     However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.     He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy.     Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power.     He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules.     Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units.     He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.  Reuter "

Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982.     In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.     The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.     Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.     Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production.

An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.     The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the spokesman added.     Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.

crude,"The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.     ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues.     Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.     Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed.     Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said.     Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.     Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year.""     Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.     John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy.""     Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time.     ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.     But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee.     Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies.     The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle.     Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.      At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests.     But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise.     Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action.""      But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.     In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.  Reuter "
grain,"Asked what the U.S. State Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.     ""If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"" Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers.     ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't,"" he said.     ""That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets, and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better,"" Shultz told the Wheat Growers.     Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife, he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced.     Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices.     Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue.  Reuter "
grain,"Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February.     But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures, and would be a new record.     The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.     The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province.     The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba.     Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.     Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.     With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting.     Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage.     The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     The current harvest's volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.     Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume.     The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  Reuter "

interest,"Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.     ""We got a little volatility Wednesday,"" said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. ""But for the moment we're still in a trading range.""     Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said.     ""It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility,"" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. ""It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy,"" he said.     Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy.     But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.     In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace.     ""The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,"" Quinn said.     Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he said.     ""We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,"" compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.     In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures.     The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures.     ""I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the trading range),"" Lacey said.  Reuter "
trade,"A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.     The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security.     Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad.     The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered.     Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices.     Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April.     Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies.     Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.     ""We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,"" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said.     The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices.     The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction.     At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders.     Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products.      Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws.

Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market.

ship,"The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.     Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a ""memorandum of understanding"" on cargo preference.     Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money.     The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.     Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet.     ""As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up, its going to be harder and harder to meet,"" Kay said.     Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.     In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.  Reuter "

trade,"The strong contribution of exports to the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data, private economists polled by Reuters said.     Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year earlier.     Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending, they said.     Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government spending by 0.2.     Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working.     However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments.     Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven.     But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.     The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.     Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.     A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's competitiveness, he said.     ""It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern,"" he added.

crude,"Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said.     The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector.     Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.     But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long.     Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.     Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.     King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy.     Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.     Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.     ""Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,"" a diplomat said.     In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.     But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term.     It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy.     Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to ""tough it out"" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves.     The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out.     Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year.     ""It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,"" he said.     Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary.     The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.     Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.     The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.     Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.     Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit.     As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

sugar,"The rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender represents some concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc, EC Commission officials said.     The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention.     The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed, the officials said.     The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates.     They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.     Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.     The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would drive down market prices further.     They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.     ""We think they realise they have gone too far,"" one official said.  REUTER "
trade,"The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.     The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1.     The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.     MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.     Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter.     If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year.     MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback.     One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up.     MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.  REUTER "

gnp,"There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.     Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of ""relaunching"" the economy.     This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move.     The sources today said the government's policy remained one of ""recovery,"" or sound finances and greater efficiency.     They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward paying off national debt.     Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added.     The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product.     Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.     The sources said that with France's economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

grain,"The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies.     Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries, were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified.     The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent, PSE.     The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct and the United States 48.2 pct.     For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC 13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.     In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.     For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.     The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and Japan, the sources said.     Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD work.     Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May.     Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva.     British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.     He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture.     However, the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said.     The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.     In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.     For example, the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.     French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale, citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC.     However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.     Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation.     The updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.     U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added.  Reuter "

gold,"A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities.     Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year.     And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market.     The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs.     But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future.     Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: ""The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk.""     Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.     The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York.     The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank.     The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.     The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.     ""Many people are worried about inflation again,"" said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. ""Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold.""     The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.     Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. ""People here understand gold, and they understand warrants,"" he said.     Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.     But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.     The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market.     Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.     Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues.     But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.     And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.     Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors.     Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. ""The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high,"" he said.  REUTER "
crude,"Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production.

Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year.     The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday.     Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: ""that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.""

No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.     ""It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported,"" one said.     Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month.     Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.     Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said.     They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year.     Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest.  Reuter "
coffee,"Zimbabwe's projected coffee output of 13,000 tonnes for 1987/88 could be reduced by drought, growers said.     The main coffee growing areas in eastern Zimbabwe have received little rain since April 1986 and the Coffee Growers' Association has begun a survey to assess the effects of the drought, a spokesman said.     Zimbabwe exported 11,000 tonnes of coffee in 1986, mainly to West Germany, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States.  Reuter "

trade,"The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said.     ""The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,"" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.     Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.     Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.     The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods.     U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.     But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.     ""In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,"" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC.     Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.     The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.     And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.     Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.     Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.     For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.     The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of ""big-ticket"" manufactured goods, notably cars.     Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.     ""The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,"" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.     The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment.     A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.     While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.     But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.     Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.     Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.     ""A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,"" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.     February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.     But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say.     The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.     But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.     ""We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,"" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.     And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.     Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. ""It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?"" one economist said.      Reuter "
coffee,"Madagascar's available coffee output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from 82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas, Agriculture Ministry sources said.     This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside, they said.     The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985.     Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said.     They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes were planted before 1930.     The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's 1986-1990 five-year plan.     In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources said.     The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content.     The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year.  Reuter "
gas,"Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years.     He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production, not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer.     On the grounds of increasing production, he said, ""I would rule out a gasoline tax.""     Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs.     He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production.     He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.     Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.     The White House said it would study the proposal, but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just passed last year.     Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction, said, ""If I were the White House, I would be cool, too.""  Reuter "
grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department is proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on insect infestations in grain shipments.     The changes in the standards would include the following:     -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live insects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.     -- Revising the definition of ""infested"" to give equal value to all insects injurious to grain.     -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, the infested level would be set at three or more live insects per representative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or more insects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be set at one or more live insects per representative sample.     -- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding a limit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.     -- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by adding a limit of 32 insect-damaged kernels per 100 grams of wheat.

crude,"Britoil Plc's BTOL.L> exploration expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker said.     He told reporters following the release of the company's 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels.     U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985.     Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well.     Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year.     He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when they were normally weaker, made him ""a bit encouraged"" about the prospects for future levels.     Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.     Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April.     End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves.     If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously.     Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3,660 billion. "

ship,"Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.     He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988, he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.     The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year's revenues.     This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides.     He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.     Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.

However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986 level of two pct.     IPECODE said demand and production would develop in parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic demand, unleashing higher import demand.     Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298 mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of French debts.     Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.     French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct in 1988, it added.

API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S. production of more than one mln barrels a day.     API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level.     So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986.

sugar,"Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review.     The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar.     The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced.     If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.     The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules.     The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand.     In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the ""green"" mark.     Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says.     The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" surrounding the export tender system.  Reuter "
interest,"The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being.     It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.     The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.     The association said generally low interest rates, prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth.     The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it said.     In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.     On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.     The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.  Reuter "

grain,"A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.     They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action.     In response to a query on what the State Department's position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.     The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.     Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union, grain industry sources said.     Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel, while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.     ""I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the Soviet Union,"" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.     ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else,"" Shultz told the farm leaders. ""That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets,"" he said.     If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP, it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.     National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary's comments.     ""His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,"" an official with the wheat group said.     The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that ""there is significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.""     In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the officials said.     An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets, said that the Shultz comments ""are consistent with what he (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,"" but said they don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.     Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.     But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.     ""If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is potentially a positive development,"" a commodity source said.  Reuter "
grain,"The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.     They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia.     The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's cereals management committee today.     The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.     The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them.     The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.     The request will be considered at the committee's next meeting, the commission sources said.     Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

crude,"The ""cross field allowance"" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.     The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.     A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.     ""The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability,"" the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced.     The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said.     On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.     In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct.     The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost.     Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.  Reuter "
oilseed,"Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.     Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks.     ""Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation,"" Glickman told the hearing.     The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.     David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.     The current soybean program ""gave us the worst of both worlds,"" ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.     ""We need some kind of market loan,"" he added.     The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.     Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a ""dilemna"" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration.     In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program.     Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.     ""Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,"" Haggard said.     However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.     He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating.     The Reagan administration has given ""mixed signals"" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.     While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.     The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois.     Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.     Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.     Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered.  Reuter "

trade,"Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's council of economic advisors, said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines.     ""Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation,"" he told the Futures Industry Association.     Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period.     ""Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery,"" he said.     Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed Japan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, ""Not enough to sustain employment growth.""     However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax reform. ""I suspect there will be further moves,"" he said.     Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases.     ""Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform,"" he said, adding that ""a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform.""     Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.     However, he said that ""sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,"" as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad.     ""I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,"" he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present ""serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.""     Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.     He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them.  Reuter "
grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said private U.S. exporters reported new sales of 900,000 tonnes of corn to the Soviet Union and 350,000 tonnes of corn switched from previously announced unknown destinations to the USSR.     The corn is for delivery during the 1986/87 marketing year and under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Long Term Grain Supply Agreement, the USDA said.     The department said exporters also reported corn sales of 143,000 tonnes for delivery to Taiwan, with 56,000 tonnes for shipment in the 1986/87 season and the balance for shipment in the 1987/88 year.

crude,"Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77 billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's annual report said.     It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States, the report said.     Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves.     Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains, the report said.     All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.     Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions ""will be an integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available at attractive prices.""     The company said it expects ""the marketing climate for natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our inventory of attractive opportunities.""     Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.  Reuter "
grain,"Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.     ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do,"" the official said.     If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but he won't go to the President and voice his objections.""     In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.     The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program.""     Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow, the State Department official said.     ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.""     USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.     The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U.S. prices down to competitive levels.     The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the State Department source said.     ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said.     The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.     Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.     ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said.  Reuter "
trade,"Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.     ""To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake,"" he told the Foreign Trade Association here.     Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis.     ""Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product,"" Denman said.     He said in the case of textiles import restrictions, however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.     ""Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe,"" Denman said.     He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.     ""This would conflict with international obligations, throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang,"" he warned of the tariff proposals.     Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors.     ""Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party,"" he said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another.

Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired.

The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay of the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area extending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.     With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the south and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to the north, the United States has 10 warships on either end of the strategic Straits of Hormuz.     The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm the exact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.     State Department officials cited concern about the safety of ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply run to the Gulf.

A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses, he said.     But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world     Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget.     At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO 800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact.     The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade.

Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.     Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.     Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.

grain,"Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern, Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather forecasting service, said.     Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said.     Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.     Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.     Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said.     The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added.     This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.     Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February.     The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.     Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters     In Australia, concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said.     For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.     Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said.     Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.     Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event' was unique.     The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83, it said.     El Nino, Spanish for ""Christ Child"" because it appears around Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds, meteorologists said.     The winds, strengthened by El Nino's ""pump"" effect, raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.     When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.     One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.     The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather said.     China, where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the May-September rains, it said.     The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.     In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end.     In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.  REUTER "

gnp,"Britain's gross domestic product (GDP) on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by 2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier, Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show.     In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.     The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based 1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against 113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of 1985.     The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985.     On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter, giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO figures show.     On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the year-ago quarter.     The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.     Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same 1985 quarter.     The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.     The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9 against 109.4 a year earlier.     For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose 2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.     The government usually considers the output measure the most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes.     It is based on output data for production industry and partial information for the rest of the economy.     The government had forecast that average measure GDP would rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.

crude,"President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.     President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying.     ""We have to study this more,"" Reagan said. ""This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more,"" he said.     Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production.     However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures.

trade,"Japan's economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus, international monetary sources said.     At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they said.     Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen's sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge when growth picks up, according to the OECD.     As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.     That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board.     The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members.     The United States, which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan's fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he said.     The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct, monetary sources said.     The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise. The yen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market.     Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.     Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians, including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping the yen will weaken, government officials said.     At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels.     Officials said that wording represented a compromise. Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months, before it weakens later in the year.     Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word ""recent"" for ""current,"" while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar's weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the word ""present,"" they said.     In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the dollar dropped some 10 yen.     The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency.     Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen.     Officials said there are already signs of that. More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad, they said.  REUTER "
gold,"Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible.     The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs.     The company said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune life.     Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said.

trade,"Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way and will be completed sometime next month.     The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far, and they said Japan would comment on the final results.     A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries.     Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May.     One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy, and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.     ""The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country, such as geography,"" the source said.     He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.     ""This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy,"" he said, without giving further details.     A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.  Reuter "

trade,"The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said.     Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session: ""We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.""     Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.     Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: ""We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.""     A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work.     Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon.     Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: ""We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions.""     Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: ""This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented.""     West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.     The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January.     The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC.  REUTER "

trade,"The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.     In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods.     The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.     Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules.     The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo AKZO.AS>, whose ""aramid"" synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm Dupont> that the fibres violate the American company's patents.     Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions.     The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.

U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.     But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.     ""If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this,"" he said.     Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.     ""We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy,"" he said. ""If we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made.""     Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates.     He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.     Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums.     He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease.     The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.     When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea.     He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied by the end of March.  Reuter "

""The tension has eased,"" the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters. ""The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.""     U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a visit to European capitals in February.     In a letter calling for the special committee meeting, Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.     The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.     Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view.     Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices.     Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings.  Reuter "
trade,"A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines.     C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall.     ""They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls,"" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said.     Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pct decline since September 1985.     The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.     Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said.     Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.     John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall.  Reuter "
gold,"Geodome Resources Ltd said based on a feasibility study of its Sunbeam Mine it will proceed with contruction and pre-production stripping as rapidly as possible.     The company said eight of nine holes drilled on the new ore zone have an average grade of 0.046 ounces of gold per ton and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.     The deposit is 400 to 500 yards from the newly designed Sunbeam pits, has large tonnage and will be drilled off this summer, the company said.     The study said ore reserves including dillution were 3,302,000 tons at 0.77 ounces of gold per ton at a cut off grade of 0.026 ounces per ton and stripping ratio of 4.24 to one.

The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers.     But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded.

trade,"Japan has agreed to drop barriers to American-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced.     Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.     He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years.     There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.     At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish.     He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.  Reuter "
grain,"There are heightened fears that ""El Nino"" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a field report.     Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area, flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.     However, it said official sources still believe that this year's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.     EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific.     The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production.     Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle.     Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists, it said.     However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and slow the decline in sugar production, it said.     If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry could receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in 1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.     Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.     It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March, April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest.     ""There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell,"" the report said.  Reuter "
livestock,Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders' immediate reaction to the cold storage report for pork bellies was neutral to slightly negative.     Frozen pork belly stocks at 34.5 mln lbs on March 1 compared with a revised 34.9 mln lbs on February 1 for a net out movement of 0.5 mln lbs.     The number on hand compared with trade guesses of 33.5 to 36 mln lbs and the year ago figure of 51.2 mln lbs.     Traders said the figure was toward the upper end of expectations and may provide slight downward pressure because of recent sharp gains in futures.  Reuter 
grain,"The Soviet Union's winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said.     Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the EF Hutton publication ""Global Crop News,"" said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat, from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.     ""Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,"" she said. ""But it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.""     Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.     The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.     However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage.     The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia, Martell said.     She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.     Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.     Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports.     However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the 1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.     Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.     In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only 24 pct of that total.     While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87 was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.  Reuter "

The department said the action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales of oilseeds to 5.0 mln dlrs from 20.0 mln dlrs and creates the new line for protein meals.     All sales under the credit lines must be registered and exports completed by September 30, 1987, it said.  Reuter "

The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990.     The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles met the new standards.     There are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures.

The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said.     West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21.     But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.     Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.

grain,"Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.     However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife.     Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said.     However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said.     World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year.     Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department said.  Reuter "
sugar,"The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments.     In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.     Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.     The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.     Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.     The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.     For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.     The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.     Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.     He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads.     U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.     Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.     USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.     ""Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing,"" Myers said.     The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

livestock,"The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said.     The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.     ""I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week,"" Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH Miller, said.     Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week.     ""We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,"" Levitt said.     Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings, they said.     However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation.     Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri, said, ""I would not look for (belly) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less.""  Reuter "
ship,"The St. Lawrence Seaway, set to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials said.     Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.     In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal, linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.     By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal.     The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.     The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain. Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.     The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.     ""It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,"" Roman Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.     The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.     ""We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,"" Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.     ""These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway,"" George Miller, vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major Canadian shipping companies, said recently.     The workers' current contract expires May 31. The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching.     The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades.     Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway.     Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.     ""We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won't see a major increase for a number of years,"" Hemsley said.     A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years, Blair said.

trade,"Trade is the most urgent problem facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark, Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.     Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.     ""The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,"" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. ""We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.""     Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October.     He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington.     On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.     In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group, Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.     ""This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,"" he said.     Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he said.     ""There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,"" he said.     In turn, he added, the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada.     Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.     ""What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in the first instance, to propose, and then governments and congresses will have judge,"" he said.     In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan. ""Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada,"" he said. REUTER  Reuter "
crude,"Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.     The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements.     ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.     An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said.     The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.     ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),"" he said.     In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted.     Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales.     These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year.     AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.     Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990.     Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.  Reuter "
trade,"The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige.     Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.     President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.     ""I am confident we will see action taken,"" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters.     ""I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,"" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.     The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries.     They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.     Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, ""The clear import of what he said is that there will be.""     ""Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,"" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said.     The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems.     Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries.     But McClure said senators told him, ""There is no doubt dumping is going on,"" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products.     The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.     In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips.     Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact.     Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.     The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.  Reuter "
gold,"The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said.     The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985.     Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.     The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985.     Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers.     Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said.     Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.     They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said.     Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who had questioned about 3,000 of the firm's former employees, police sources said.

crude,"World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.     Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.     He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments.     Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half.     Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.     Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit.     Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy.     ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable said in his arrival statement.     But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.     ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport.     Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.     Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.     Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.     Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment.     Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold.     But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.     Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.     Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.     It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation.      He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.     Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.

trade,"Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured.     Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,"" he said.     ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,"" Moore said.     He added: ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000.""     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the ""Uruguay round"" talks last Sepember. The meeting is also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in June.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.""     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.""     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.     Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons.

He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We really don't talk about the dollar.""     He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries.     ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong,"" he said.     ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said.     While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said.     ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the interview.     Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries.  REUTER "

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.     European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.     Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes.     New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.     Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. ""Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.""     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. ""That's a very healthy development,"" he added.""If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.""     ""Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,"" Yeutter said.     ""They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.""

ship,"Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.     Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.""      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.     The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.     The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda.""     He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.""     Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.""     ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,"" he said.

crude,"The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.     Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.     This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.     Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said.     Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said.     Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.     By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.     Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.     Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said.     At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.     Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.     For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.     He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration.  REUTER "

He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and oil-related items.

crude,"World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.     Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.     It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said.     McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.     Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.     He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.     More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said.     McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability.     ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,"" he said.     Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added.  REUTER "

Taiwan's surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, government figures show.

crude,"A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here.     A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.     Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.     The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said.     He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct.     ""The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,"" Story said.     Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said.     The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure.  REUTER "

Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.     Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.     ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness, he said.     ""The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports,"" he added.  REUTER "
interest,"West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.     But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.     The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said.     Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. ""The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,"" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study.     It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.     West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar.     West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.     ""It's not a taboo,"" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said.     But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.     The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.  Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.     It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.     But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing.     This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.     Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.     Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November.     Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said.     Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.     The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.     West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.     Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes.     But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing.     The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits.     The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.     The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

trade,"Japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy.     Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved.     Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting, said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy, but did not elaborate.     Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits, payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.     Despite great potential, developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.     The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.     ""It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled,"" Hata said.     Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others.     In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end.     As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market more open to developing countries, he said.

Coffee exports rose to 753 mln dlrs from 580 mln in 1985, but rubber shipments fell to 625 mln from 720 mln and tin to 180.6 mln from 246 mln, weekly central bank figures show.     Indonesia hopes to boost its non-oil exports to make up for oil revenue lost because of lower prices.

trade,"Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.     In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries.      He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem.     ""We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform,"" Dawkins said.     The Venice summit is scheduled for June.     He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system.     Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes.     ""We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice.""     The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years, he said.

gnp,"Japan is expected to post a 3.6 pct rise in real gross national product in 1987/88, higher than the official 3.5 pct target, a private economic institute said.     The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter, partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries.     The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year.     The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy.     Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to 90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated 98 billion in the current fiscal year, it said.  REUTER "
trade,"Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils.     Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted.     He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.     Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that ""I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.""     He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.     ""The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,"" he said.  REUTER "
crude,"The entire British Petroleum Co PLC refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said.     He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the 19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.     But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.     The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.     He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.     The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said.     This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.     Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.  REUTER "

gnp,"French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct, the same as last year, due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.     Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.

sugar,"A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today.     ""Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution,"" he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.     Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention.     At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.     Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so.     Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date.     The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.  REUTER "
grain,"Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast.     But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.     Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.     The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said.     Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops.     ""The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers' income,"" AWF said.

""Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.""     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago.

""Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,"" Yeutter said.     ""They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.""

Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.""     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.""     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

coffee,"Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.     The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.     The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda's total exports.     The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.     These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said     Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports.     Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks.     However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements.     Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.     Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.     These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said.     According to the sources, the board's financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts.     The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said.     The sources said the CMB's price structure had been overtaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.     ""The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,"" one of the sources said.     The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political strife.

crude,"The world's dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.     ""Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,"" McIvor said.     Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.     McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.     ""Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,"" McIvor said.     ""The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,"" he added.     McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 ""one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.""     McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more ""super giants"", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.     ""Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)."" McIvor said.     McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline.     But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa.     McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.     ""The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,"" McIvor said.     McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.     Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but ""the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.""     McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.     ""Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,"" McIvor said.     ""Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,"" he added.  Reuter "

trade,"Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further.     ""We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,"" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.     ""If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.""     The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors.     Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action.     In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.     Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year.     He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market.     ""We have almost no grey market,"" he said. ""Supply is diminishing.""     To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of Texas Instruments Inc>.     Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.     The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong.     Yamamoto admitted that Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.     ""If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,"" he said.     The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.     He also called the case ""strange,"" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

grain,"Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago.     Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.     Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the ""belg"" (small) rains which fall at this time of year.     The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their stocks of seed.     Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains.     The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.  Reuter "

grain,"Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders.     Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders.     Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.     As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.     Barreto said, ""My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part."" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.     Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.     ""There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"" Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.     The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.

The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.

Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.     The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade.

All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries.     The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.     They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports.

Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les Echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment.     CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation.     Disinflation was an absolute priority, Neeser told journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years.  Reuter "
crude,"Energy analyst Edward Krapels said the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S. dependence on imports below 50 pct.     ""On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent, variable import tariff is most persuasive,"" Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.     ""An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels,"" Krapels said.     But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.     Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the subcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.

crude,"Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carried out his first major government shakeup in five years tonight, naming a new oil minister in shuffling three posts.     One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in a presidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in the government of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruled Iraq since a revolution in 1968.     The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oil minister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi.     Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significant government reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister of heavy industries.  Reuter "
ship,"Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.     The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack.     But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours.     The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.     Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.  Reuter "
oilseed,"Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.     Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program ""dilemma"" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate.     Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.     Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.     The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.     Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs.     He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an ""umbrella"" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.     Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for some form of income support, Amstutz said ""the competitive problem is the most severe."" He said USDA is still studying the situation and ""no resolution"" has yet been found.  Reuter "
grain,"U.S. Agriculture undersecretary Dan Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the Soviet Union about the competitiveness of U.S. wheat prices but would not discuss making U.S. wheat prices ""cheap.""     ""There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap,"" Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing.     Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat price was competitive or cheap.     ""I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness,"" Amstutz said.     However, Amstutz added that the United States would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow ""if the issue is being cheap.""     Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.     Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-term grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at ""prices in effect in this country.""     Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about expanding the export enhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union.  Reuter "

trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.""     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,"" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said ""one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package.""  REUTER "
trade,"Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils.     Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted.     He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.     Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that ""I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.""     He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.     ""The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,"" he said.  REUTER "
crude,"Australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.     He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.     Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation.     Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years.     These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said.     The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.     ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,"" Evans said.     He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.     As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects.     APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.     Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     ""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,"" he said. ""The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.""     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said.     ""Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round,"" he said.     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     ""It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"" he said.     ""They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,"" he said.  REUTER "
trade,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.     At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors.     Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S.     That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.     Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.     Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.     In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets.

Under the program, workers building roads, digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.     The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said.

Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy.     Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years.     Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.     ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he said.     He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries.     Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy.     However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.     Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country.  REUTER "

crude,"The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure.     The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.     As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum.     APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said.     It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.     Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.     ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,"" the APEA council said.     The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said.     The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.  REUTER "

She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.

European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     ""The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,"" she said.     However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well.  REUTER "
crude,"Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher, according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview.     The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd.     As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota.  REUTER "
crude,"The U.S. Has offered warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti-ship missile batteries, Defence Department officials said.     The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit.     Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made ""Silkworm"" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West.     Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.     White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which represents U.S. Interests in Iran.     Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on Sunday.     Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict.  REUTER "
trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April.     ""We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date,"" he said.

Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).     He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries.     Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka.

interest,"The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22.     The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.     Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.     The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks.     However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.     The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred.     Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion. For all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily average reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.  REUTER "

trade,"A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     ""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,"" he said. ""The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.""     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. ""Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.""     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     ""It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"" he said.

trade,"World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers.     ""We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,"" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta.     Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.     The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted.     But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.     ""The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,"" he stated.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half.     Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto.     He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.     ""The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world,"" he said.     The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.     The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.     The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies.     Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

crude,"U.S. Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was ""optimistic"" about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration.     Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was ""heavy and strong"" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry.     Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports.     In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif. ""We intend to keep that debate open,"" Herrington said.     However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee ""is not economical.""     Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.     Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who requested the comprehensive national security study, was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.

grain,"Emergency action to distribute European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.     Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.     The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities.     The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31.     But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.     The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.     However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates.     On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.  Reuter "

crude,"A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies.     The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.     The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.     A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.     But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration.     ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. ""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,"" he said.     The oil companies, Amoco Corp AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp XON>, Mobil Corp MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc TX> and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses.     The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.     Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.     The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.  Reuter "

They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels.     Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.     The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another  draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.     For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels.     Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.     U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.     Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week.     The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell.     The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20.     Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said.     Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc.  Reuter "

They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on farmers' incomes.     Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission's overall package, they said.     As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices.

coffee,"Colombia's coffee export revenue dropped 97 mln dlrs to 233.6 mln dlrs for the first two months of the year against 330.9 mln dlrs in the similar period of 1986, central bank preliminary figures show.     Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices following the failure to re-introduce international coffee export quotas, but they said Colombia could compensate the drop with higher exports in calendar 1987.     Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2.33 billion dlrs, according to the bank.     Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers' Federation, last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a lb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln dlrs for Colombia.     But he stressed that Colombia, with stockpiles of 10 mln (60-kg) bags, had the capacity to export more and would use a recently-introduced more flexible marketing policy to do so.  Reuter "

grain,"With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year's level of 85 pct.     Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program.     The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30.     USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said.     USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official told Reuters.     A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said.     ""A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn't look very likely now,"" he said.     To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program.  Reuter "
grain,"The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution.     The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs.     Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution.     The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.     Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.     But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.     With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op.     Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc.     Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis.     Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.     Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.     Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.     Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.     ""The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,"" he said. ""There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.""     One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits.     But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served ""to make folks gun-shy,"" Hanes said.     Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.     A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm ""was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.""     ""We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,"" he said. ""But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.""     Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative.     ""In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,"" he said but added, ""The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.""     Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. ""I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.""     In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed.     Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as ""patronage refunds"" to the members.     Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.     ""You're dealing with substantially lower volume,"" Mulligan said. ""Lower volume translates into higher costs.""     According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.     Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year.     However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out.  Reuter "

The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.     The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound.     He added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.     The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.     While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters say the problems have been manageable.     ""It hasn't been critical by any means,"" said a coffee trader in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships.

trade,"The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security.     The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.     The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries.     Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.     ""This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,"" the Washington Democrat said.     The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls.     Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments.     It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.

The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.     As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries.

He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming ""one of the world's industrial lightweights.""     Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged  violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.     The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.     But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.     Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping.     Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive.     But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry.

grain,"U.S. corn acreage this year is  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said.     USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.     Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels.     Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said.     ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year.""     Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.     Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.     If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.     Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels.     Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.     ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production,"" an analyst said.     A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said.     High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said.     In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.     ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"" he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas.     Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.     U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980's.     U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.     Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.     ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said.     Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said.     Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage.     ""To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives,"" an analyst said.  Reuter "
trade,"Leading U.S. farm state senators are seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP, to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.     Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading practices.     Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies, sources said.     The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor (D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) -- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from Canadian imports.     The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), would clarify the definition of ""industry"" in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.     Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U.S. producers.     The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.  Reuter "

sugar,"The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.     Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.     ""With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines,"" Huckaby said.     By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.     Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period ""we could get away without having to increase the quota.""     He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified.     Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later this year, a refiner spokesman said.     However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request.     Following the refiners' request, representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said.     The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said.     Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.     Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said ""As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration.""  Reuter "
trade,"External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute.     In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.     ""We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,"" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period.     But he said the opposition parties should be careful ""not to raise false alarms too early.""     The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.     Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S.     Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.     In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another ""trade harrassment"" from the U.S. and criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be protected.     ""We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,"" Axworthy said.     Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S.     Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade.     But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S.     ""What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,"" Clark said.     Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies.

sugar,"The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters.     They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.     ""The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock,"" a senior official said.     He said the government has finalised an agreement with E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the 45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.     Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.     The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.     Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance. The Department and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.     An Importers Association official said that ""even if the Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily buy more.""     This is because the Association would still have to compete with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.     The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting April 1.

They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.     Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25.     The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform.     Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.     Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.     The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said.     Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said.     Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.

The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook.     With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said.     The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.     The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels.     PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.     ""We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude,"" Fesharaki said.     There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.     But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.

Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000 in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply after March, but in recent years production from March to the end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.     Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and consumption 57,800.     Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87 production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.  Reuter "
sugar,"Trade house sources said China is expected to step up its sugar purchases following yesterday's steep drop in world sugar prices.     The consensus is that the Chinese will buy between 200,000 and 400,000 tonnes of raw sugar.     ""China is short of foreign exchange and a drop in prices is usually taken as a buying opportunity by Peking,"" one trader said.     Yesterday, prices on the New York world sugar market plummeted by 0.58 to 0.50 cent on heavy liquidation by speculators, disenchanted over the market's lack of rallying power.     Speculation is that China will need the sugar for the May/July period.  Reuter "
trade,"The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation, credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.     The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and State, the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.     At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S. programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).     The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill, offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.     Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program.     The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.     The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.     Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries ""friendly to the United States"" would be eligible to host the trade missions.     Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.     The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time employees, a FAS spokesman said.  Reuter "
trade,"Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan dominate the world electronics market.     Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United States would insist Japan open its markets to U.S. products as the U.S. market is open to Japanese products.     Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs, Baldrige said, ""I'm not prepared to say that, but it certainly would be one of the alternatives studied.""     Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications market.     ""I can only conclude that the common objective of the Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world electronics market. Given the importance of this market to U.S. industry in general and our defense base in particular, we cannot stand by idly,"" he said.     He said it was these concerns about national security which led him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan.  Reuter "

Consumer prices were on average three pct higher than in February 1986, the office said. This compared with a year on year rise of 2.7 pct in January, the lowest for 25 years, and was the highest figure since October.

crude,"Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken.     One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods.     Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the tax code, but would look at the proposal.     Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security.     The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security.     He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.     Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test, spurring production but fail the second and third.     He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil  workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.     A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production.     In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.     Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:     - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.     - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.     - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.     - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.     Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.     He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which may hold nine billion barrels.     Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to  amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry.     Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.     This, he said, would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption.      Reuter "
crude,"Canada's federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced.     The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.     The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987.     Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.     The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.     Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.     He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986.     Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said.     The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring.     An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said.     Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said.     He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.  Reuter "

sugar,"A leading U.S. farm-state Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.     ""We're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),"" Rep. Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told Reuters in an interview.     Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.     Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.     ""I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work,"" he said.     ""Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"" said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.     A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.     A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.     ""I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"" Huckaby said.     However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.     He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U.S.     But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.     Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.     ""This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved,"" Huckaby said.     Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.     Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.     ""I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?"" he said.     Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said ""You build a fragile house if you do it that way.""     Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain.     But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy.     Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year.     Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program.     ""The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't think it will get up a head of steam,"" Huckaby said.     He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved.     Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market.  Reuter "

ship,"Brazil's labour unrest is spreading, with many banks, universities and government statistical offices on strike and more pay disputes looming.     Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launched yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000 workforce.     The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.     For the government the one positive development on the labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's 40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.     A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies and that the strike looked close to an end.     Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil's crisis-laden economy.     ""If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a serious effect because normal financial operations will grind to a halt,"" said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.     Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal universities launched a national strike, with a broad political demand as well as a pay claim.     David Fleischer, head of the political science department in Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Association of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional inquiry into what had happened to government education funds.     He said the universities were strapped for cash and that the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition government, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using education funds for projects which had helped their candidates in elections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.

grain,"Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April, trade sources said.     They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February.     The new forecast is still higher than last season's record total production.     Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.     Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires.     The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares.     The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.     Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.     The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts.     In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.     The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.     The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86.     The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.     This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.     The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.     A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields.     The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes.     The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.     The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.     Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  Reuter "

trade,"The chairman of the U.S. Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week.     The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.     Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners.     ""We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,"" the Texas Democrat said in a statement.     ""I do not question Canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned,"" he added.     Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval.     ""I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful,"" Bentsen said.

crude,"Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its annual report said.     The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of the judgement won by Pennzoil Co PZL> against Texaco on charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire Getty Oil Co.     The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in this case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having to seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the federal bankruptcy code.     Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs, Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than March 30.     Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.     However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of 1985.     Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln, respectively.     Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from 1.55 billion.     The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000 barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day -- representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.     Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at the end of 1985.  Reuter "

trade,"Brazil wants to increase its steel exports to the United States, now limited because of tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) said.     Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.     In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations, the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United States by about 30 pct in 1985.     The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes, increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in 1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.

Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986 and will continue to drop in this quarter.     The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.

oilseed,"U.S. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year.     ""I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening. Politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a senior farm-state senator said.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.     ""I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"" American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.     Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.     His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administration's position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers' income.     Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly.     ""There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz proposal,"" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.     ""Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan,"" O'Conner said.     Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or 4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.  Reuter "
trade,"The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement.     In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and should continue until the United States is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement.     The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required.     ""America's interests require that agreements be honored and that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments,"" the trade group said.     The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday.

crude,"U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20 to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.     In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier.     Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from 6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said.     Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said.     Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd, up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said.     In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8 pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said.     Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said.     So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31 mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.

crude,"Unocal Corp said it intends to increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in 1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986.     The company said in its annual report that it would increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986's 595 mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels.     The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987 remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocal said.     The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil and condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986, compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said.     The company said its net crude oil and condensate production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to 251,300 bpd in 1985.     Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07 billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Net natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986, down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.     Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was 12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in 1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.     Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.     In the annual report, the company called for imposition of an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.     ""Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel     will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise in imports,"" Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.     ""Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will once again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,"" Hartley said.  Reuter "
crude,"Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any ""meaningful settlement offer"" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco.     In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again.     ""To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter,"" Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report.     Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.     Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.      The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.     U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985.     The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.     Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico's Mobile Bay area.     ""Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,"" the company said.

grain,"Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.     The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said.     USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said.     The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending.     Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.     Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.     USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage.     It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said.     The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold.     The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates.     The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash.     Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA.     Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate.     Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.     The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives.     The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said.     However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.     The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year.     USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.     Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters.  Reuter "

trade,"The European Community (EC) considers talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.     He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.     He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.     Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.     De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.     Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible.     But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.     ""We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached, and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track - and that's all,"" de Clercq said.     ""If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the only urgent thing,"" he said.

The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2.5 Ecus below this level.     But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers.     The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.     The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it.     EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move which could drive down market prices further.  REUTER "
bop,"West Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.     The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.     The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986.     A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.     Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January.     The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February. But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     Within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.     Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged.     ""The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least,"" said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.     He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December.     ""The trend is clearly lower,"" he said.     This economist, who declined to be named, said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

livestock,"Japan's plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.     ""Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,"" a Housewives Association of Japan official said.     Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.     Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against 1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.     The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling at 1,325 against 1,420.     Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone.     The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks, both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when prices are below.     But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.     Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about half those in Japan.     But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S. Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.     The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.     American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C. Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month.     In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.     In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from 168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.  REUTER "
trade,"Firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry said.      The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.     But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.     Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. ""This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps,"" he said.     The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade, he added.     Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery times and good service.     Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's exporters.     Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas, tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

gnp,"Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.     The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October.     Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.     It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.     Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.     Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.     It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985.     ""In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under strict control... The resource gap in the government's finances on current account will be bridged over the near term,"" Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report.     The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.     The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986.  REUTER "
trade,"Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said.     The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.     Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January.     Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.     Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected.     The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures.     The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.     The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln.     The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import volume seems to have stablised.

grain,"The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.     In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.     The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.     The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.     At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.     Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise.     After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said.     Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said.     It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.     After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

trade,"The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.     Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.     ""The figures are unreservedly good,"" Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.     Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.     The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.     But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.     There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.     Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.     Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.     However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods.     However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.     He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry.     The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers, Harwood said.     U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated.     Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960.     However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.     Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping.

grain,"Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report.     Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.     In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production.     A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.     The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries.     They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.     Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period.     This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said.     The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production.     The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.     These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.     For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says.     The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India.     The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages.     In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

trade,"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.     ""I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think it's a very good idea,"" Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network's ""Moneyline"" television program.     He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.     Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.     ""The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take,"" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.     On the international front, Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.     Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries.     The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations' ""investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt there.""

The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said.     Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.     This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. ""The news did come as a very, very substantial relief,"" he said.     However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed.  REUTER "

She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.     The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices.

Some estimated the Maple Leaf's West German market share at 60 pct.

Including the tax, the one-ounce coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.     Competition may also come from new gold coins, including Belgium's ECU, which began sales today.

grain,"A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied, a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het Comite, told Reuters.     Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and, since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.     The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country.     Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board.     The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.     The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged ""because the bill (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins."" The name of the company is not being made public.     The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg, and ""as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.""     Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected, the spokesman said.     Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.  Reuter "

crude,"British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.     ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,"" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own.     ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.     ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.     One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.     Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive.     U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.     Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid.     British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.     Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry.     Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices.     ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.     ""They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.     Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year.     They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope.     Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves.     ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said.     Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one.     After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S.     ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.     In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.       Reuter "

""It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major decisions are taken,"" Cardenas told journalists.

Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil would not change its coffee policies.

grain,"French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets.     The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.     ""I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms,"" Guillaume told the annual conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA  (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).     Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.     Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months.     There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output.     But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA's farmers.     His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers.     Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm sector.     ""The Minister's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks,"" he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a ministerial level.     Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring.     Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.     There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers' indebtedness, he said.     Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.     The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.  Reuter "

GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in 1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.      But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the ministry said.     The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy.     These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3 pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.     They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.     On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.  Reuter "

Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.      ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said.      Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.      Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said.      ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said. ""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?""       J.C. Walter of Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.      ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.      He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said.  Reuter "
trade,"The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.      By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report.     The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said.     GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years.     GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.     Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said.     ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,"" the report said.     GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism.     The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.     The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.     ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,"" the report said.     GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar.     ""Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.""     But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive.     It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad.     World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year.     Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said.     Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said.     The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.  REUTER "
cpi,"Japan's consumer price index (base 1985) was unchanged at 99.7 in February from a month earlier, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.     The index showed a 0.4 pct drop in January.     The February index was down one pct from a year earlier for the third consecutive year-on-year drop.     In January, the index fell 1.1 pct from a year earlier, the first drop of over one pct since a 1.3 pct drop in September 1958.     In February petrol prices increased but winter clothing prices stayed low and vegetable prices fell.     The February year on year fall was due to lower vegetable, fuel oil, petrol, electricity and gas prices, and despite higher housing, education, footwear and clothing costs.     The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) in mid-March rose 0.4 pct from a month earlier to 100.6, reflecting higher vegetable prices.

trade,"The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said.     They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate.     There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.     U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation.     The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors.     Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors.     In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.     The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed.     The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors.     A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union.     U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers.  REUTER "

trade,"India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange.     Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.     Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).     ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading.     One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports.     However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said.     Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.     However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.     Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86.     Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.     The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.     But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.     One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering.     The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.     ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible.     ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade official said.     Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.     Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.     In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.     ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"" he added.     Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.     But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added.     ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants.""     Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty.     ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy.""  REUTER "

sugar,"Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.     Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met.     He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption.     Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.     He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.     ""The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,"" Yulo said.     Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos.     Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.     The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.     Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.     ""I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,"" he said. ""But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level.""     ""The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.     Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA's bid to control production.     ""We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,"" he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production.     He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry.     ""The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,"" Yulo said. ""They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.""     He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.     ""When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce sugar,"" he said.     Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.     ""As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices,"" Yulo said.     ""If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.""     He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.     ""If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year,"" he said.     Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production.     He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.     ""But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,"" he said. ""Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification.""     Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.     The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.     Yulo said despite next year's increased production target, some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.     ""At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986/87 season,"" he said. ""We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season.""  REUTER "

Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year ""will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment.""     Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.     Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms in 1986.     DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct.     Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency, he said.

trade,"Japan today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.     ""The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly,"" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said.     The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in January and 4.77 billion a year ago.     The current account surplus, which includes trade in services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.     After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from a record 9.58 billion in January.     ""In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength,"" said William Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.     A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.     ""On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down,"" Jardine's Rasmussen said.     But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.     Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January.     The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January.     This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports, they said.     But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japan's trading partners.  REUTER "

With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.     Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage.     It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America, China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world, he said.     Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.     Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade.     ""Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year,"" Conable told Reuters after his speech.

But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day.     Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.     But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.     Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures.     He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said.     Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.     They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct.     Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit.     To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans.     A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.     Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.     While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations.     A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp.     The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.

sugar,"Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.     The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.     Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.     Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar.     Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said.     Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added.     Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.     Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.     Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders said.     Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.     Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

This compares with a year earlier surplus of 958.9 mln rand.     Exports rose slightly to 3.36 billion rand in February from 3.31 billion in January but imports fell to 1.74 billion from 2.41 billion.

trade,"India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange.     Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.     Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).     ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading.     One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports.     However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said.     Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.     However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.     Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86.     Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.     The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.     But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.     One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering.     The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.     ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible.     ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade official said.     Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.     Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.  Reuter "

The trade surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 4.77 billion a year earlier and 5.70 billion in January.     The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40 billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from 12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said.     Japan's February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from 14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from 10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January.     The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January.     Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding.     Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January.     The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37 billion in January. Short-term capital account payments swung to a 1.28 billion dlr deficit in February from a 1.60 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.44 billion dlr surplus in January.     Errors and omissions were 2.65 billion dlrs in surplus, compared with a 1.27 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.10 billion deficit in January.

cpi,"U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain, the Labor Department said.     The CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) rose to 329.0 in February, the department said.     Prices for petroleum-based energy rose sharply for a second consecutive month during February but by less than in January, the department said.     Energy prices rose 1.9 pct last month after a 3.0 pct rise in January, accounting for one-third of the overall CPI rise.     For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an unadjusted 2.1 pct.     Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges were responsible for the moderation.     Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said.     Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.     Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below price levels of February 1986.     Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January increase. Grocery store food prices were up 0.4 pct, the same as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a third consecutive month, the department said.     Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department said.     The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men's clothing, was responsible for the advance.     Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco prices, up 0.9 pct after a 2.0 pct January increase, accounted for 30 pct of the index rise, the department said.  Reuter "

crude,"Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.     Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.""     He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean.     ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,"" General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference.     He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.     Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.     The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.      Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.     The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.     Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests ""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements.""     Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights.""     Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.     Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached.     In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words.""     Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek fleet is not at its naval base.""     Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf.     Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it.     Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.     He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously, and perhaps even before the war.""  REUTER "

trade,"The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources said.     ""We can't say ""yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)"" but this is definitely being considered,"" an official said.     His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.     Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. ""There's a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan,"" another government official told Reuters.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.     She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.     The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show.     A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to ""coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences"" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called ""restrictive conditions"" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan's international telecommunications market.     The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action.     Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.     58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.     The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements.     ""The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance,"" one official said.     ""This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times,"" the official added.     Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said.     British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.     ""There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,"" he said, adding ""(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight."" Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade ""strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.""     The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.     But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.     Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.     In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.     There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week.     Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.  REUTER   "

grain,"The Agriculture Department's widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA official said.     All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA.     USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts, depending on what the differential is.     USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.     ""We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any nearby time,"" Burgess said.     Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. ""If we're off the mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the mark if we're too low?"" he said.     While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall, Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being planned right now.     ""We don't tinker.

While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible, most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.

trade,"President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House officials said.     There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week.     Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.     The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.     They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.

gnp,"The South African Reserve Bank, confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct in the 1985 final quarter.     The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 1.5 pct contraction in 1985.     But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.     GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such payments or outflows.     The bank also said there were indications the country's economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.     With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production.     The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987. Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.     Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70 billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total annual value of import payments.     The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.     The bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be ""rebuilt to more comfortable levels.""     ""This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for,"" the bank said.  REUTER "

gold,"The price of gold bullion and share prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.     ""There's been a tug of war between the (currency) speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it looks like the game has gone to the speculators,"" said John Ing at Maison Placements Canada Inc.     The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.     A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.     Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd, noted that ""a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars. If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.""     A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.     Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs, with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.     However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself, causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign the buying pressure is slowing down. ""The stocks have run an incredible way,"" Cohen said.     On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2, Campbell Red Lake Mines CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.     The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268 points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at 43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.     Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has increased six pct. ""Canadian golds have been the top performing index this year,"" he noted.     In the U.S., there is ""too much money chasing too few stocks,"" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash, he added.     Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold and silver prices to narrow.

cpi,"Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year's pace, economists said.     ""Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.     U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month.     The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.     Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges.     ""There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     Economists said the latest CPI supports existing expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.     The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986. Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.     Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture.     ""As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

wheat,"A cold air mass working its way south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.     ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said.     Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the system.     If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.     Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.     ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26 degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have a lot of wind.""     ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he said.     Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable. Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.  Reuter "
ship,"McLean Industries Inc said its two shipping subsidiaries -- UNITED States Lines Inc and United States Lines (S.A.)

The units have been operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November.     McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX Corp's CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its Transpacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land.     McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln dlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two McLean subsidiaries.     As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer its South American Service to Crowley Maritime Corp>'s American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a participation based on American Transport's South American revenues.     McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have been returned to Crowley.     McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.) subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American Transport.     The company said both agreements in principle have been approved by directors of the companies involved, but still need court, regulatory and lender approval.     McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to schedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements, adding that the court has granted the company's request to extend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to file a proposed plan of reorganization.     It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no significant shipping assets except 12 New York class vessels, which are not in operation and are expected to be sold.     McLean said its shipping units are returning the vessels operating in foreign commerce to United States ports to permit the planned transfer to purchasers.

Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman Shoichi Saba stated: ""EIAJ believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement.""     ""We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to resist emotional biases,"" he said.     Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of the pact.     The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports.     Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.

He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as previously annnounced unless Greek vessels did so.     The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters' questions about an announcement last night that Greece had asked the United States to suspend operations at one of the American military bases here due to the crisis.

""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.     While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute.     Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.     Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.     Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact.     That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.     Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriate measures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.     Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue.     But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs.     Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.     But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. ""It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date,"" Tamura said.     In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports.     Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work.     They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.     While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.     The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users, some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors.     A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise.

""In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters,"" the statement added.     An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying.

Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas.     Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today.     He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: ""We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind.""     Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved.

crude,"The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues.     A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986.     The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).     The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production.     These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.     ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"" the study said.     It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.     The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.     It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

coffee,"A senior Nicaraguan official said a recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.     Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices.     London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.     Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically.     He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.     Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.     Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said.     He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers.  REUTER "

That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April.     While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said.     ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"" one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do something to respond to that.""     In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government.     Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said.     They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts.     The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action.     ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.     He accused the U.S. Of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S. Action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""     Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations.     Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.     Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.  REUTER "
trade,"The U.S. Expects more harmonious talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade.     ""The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters.     ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect, more harmonious than usual.""     Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States.     During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S. Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a circuitous route. That angered Washington.     The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said.     More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community  threatened to become a trade war.     In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.     Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad, supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad.     A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets.""     Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).     To Washington, as one official put it, ""CAP is the root of all evil"" in international food trade because it subsidises farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

sugar,"Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said.     The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions, he said from Brisbane.     Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month, he said.     The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which is harvested from around June to December.     He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane.     But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.     ""It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls,"" he said.  REUTER "
crude,"Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.     Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.     But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year.     Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures.     The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.     Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.     He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September.     In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.     The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.     ""About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,"" the paper said.     However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said.     Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.     A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market.  REUTER "
trade,"The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.     The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September.     A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters ""Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect.""     The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.      Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices.     ""I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,"" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.     A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.     Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely.     Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves.     ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,"" said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.     ""The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,"" he said.     Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.     ""The American approach is full of contradictions,"" Jardine Fleming's Edwards said.     ""If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,"" Edwards said.     But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.     Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said ""The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.""  REUTER "
grain,"Japanese feed and starch makers actively bought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/September shipment in view of bullish freight rates following active inquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said.     Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period.     ""Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April,"" one source said.     The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market.     Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an anticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability.

Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show.     The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S. Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there.     The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April 20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July shipment, the sources said.     As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment.

ship,"Japan's ailing shipyards have won approval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash production to about half of total capacity for one year, effective April 1, industry sources said.     The approval follows an act of parliament passed last week designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of capacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said.     The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructing ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuilding output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes in 1987/88, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said.     Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel in 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish.

trade,"Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said.     As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.     The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.     The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.""     Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.     The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact.     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture.     On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.     Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,"" he said.     ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said.     Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.""     And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.     Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.     Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem.     ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.     ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers.     Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.     Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue.     He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries.     A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures. ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.  REUTER "

crude,"Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased.     A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash.     Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.     The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.     Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened.     The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.     Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive.     The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters.

gnp,"Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1 pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in December but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and October, Statistics Canada said.     January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5 pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's level.     January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a year ago.     The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in manufacturing and construction.     Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood, machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups. Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles and parts, however.     In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and communication were more than offset by declines in transportation, storage and the retail trade.  Reuter "
grain,"Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.     Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.     The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.     The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.     In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected.     There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks.     ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.     Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.     The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed.     It said the government's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""     The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation"" in the economy, the letter said.     The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced subsequently.""     The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May.     The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986.  Reuter "

coffee,"The United States does not expect the executive board meeting of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations on reinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.     The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks earlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are expected because there is no indication the negotiating positions of major producers and consumers have changed.     The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of coffee quotas, that ""objective criteria"" be set for establishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to be identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas based on a traditional formula.     The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if some new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the official said.     The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London.  Reuter "

coffee,"Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said.     ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.     ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.      ""Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,"" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said.      The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said.      At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.     The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.     ""I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),"" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.     Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting.     If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.     When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.     Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using ""objective criteria,"" which would have threatened Brazil's share.     At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO ""dissident"" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting.     However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity.     London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.  Reuter "
trade,"The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit.     ""Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.     ""If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,"" the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill.     Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.     Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.     Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.     They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.     In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.     Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services.     The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.     Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties.     The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports.     The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.     Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.     The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years.     ""I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken away from American business,"" Gephardt said.     The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision.      "
crude,"Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean  last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere, according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.

coffee,"The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said.     They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February.     To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.     However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said.     They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price.     Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.     The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week.     ""Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,"" one exporter said.     However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.     There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said.     Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales.     This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale. "
crude,"U.S. refiners will have to reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here.      ""If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc     ""If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,"" he added.      Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20.      The API said that with the higher crude oil runs,  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the API said.      Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.      ""The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,"" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.      Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said.      Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. ""I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,"" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.  Reuter "

The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp UNP>.

According to the official, Venezuela is searching worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not mention where the company was looking.      Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to refiners.

trade,"A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products.     Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied, ""That would be the height of foolishness.""     In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.     Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.     President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress.     ""I think it's about time,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, ""It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing.""     Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.     Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products.     Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.     ""It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we're serious,"" Smart said of the White House trade sanctions.     The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.     ""All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be,"" he said.     Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.  Reuter "
interest,"The Federal Reserve's move to easier monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter, analysts said.     A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.     ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     Stone said economic data available by late June may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.     All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.     The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.     Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to the April-June quarter, follow:     - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.     - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range.     - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.     - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.     - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct annual rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.     ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.     ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.     Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively. He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative.     Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow  government spending and less construction. Only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth.     He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds, with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct, respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.     Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.     David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20 pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.     Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.     The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S. trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers. ......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS.... ....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime.. Nikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..

crude,"Development of costly shale oil, liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies, will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.     Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, ""By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country's energy supply.""     McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.     ""You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be prepared,"" McMillan said.     He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said.     Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels.     The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world's known oil reserves.     ""We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later,"" Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years.     Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil.     The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

dlr,"Brazilian President Jose Sarney announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at promoting imports of foreign goods.     In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face ""current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the purchase of goods.""     The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above the official rate.     Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).     Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy.     The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's trade policy, with participation of the private sector.

crude,"The U.S. should reassess its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.      ""The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report, mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"" Ebinger said.      He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.      ""Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests,"" Ebinger said.      Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring.     But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.     There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.     He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production.     OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.     OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.     Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.  Reuter "

He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150 yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level counter to the spirit of the Paris accord.     Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawa said Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.     Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year today, Miyazawa said.     Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception that major nations were not doing enough to implement their policies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.     He said that now was the time for major nations to act under the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France, Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to prop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action.  REUTER "

trade,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said.     Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said.     ""The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,"" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. ""So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.""     Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.     ""Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,"" Uchida said. ""His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.""     Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said.     The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said.     ""Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,"" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.     This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.     The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.     ""If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,"" Shiratori said.     But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said.     However, ""unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,"" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling.     ""If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,"" he said.     Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said.     But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said.     ""One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,"" Sterling said.  REUTER "
coffee,"India cut the export duty on coffee to 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees, effective March 23, a Coffee Board official said.     The reduction should help India reach its coffee export target of 90,000 tonnes in fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31, against provisionally estimated exports of 75,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and an actual 99,254 tonnes in 1985/86, he said.     India is likely to press for international export quotas at a meeting of coffee producers in London this week because of depressed prices, he added.     The International Coffee Organisation, which represents both consumers and producers, has so far failed to reach agreement on quotas.     India feels it will be useful to have quotas now because the slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately, he said.     Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged after a drought devastated Brazil's coffee crop.  REUTER "

trade,"Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan.     Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.     The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.     But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.     ""The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.,"" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. ""Basically, their policies are pretty much the same.""     But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.     ""In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,"" he added. ""In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.""     Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called ""countervailing duties"" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.     In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.     In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.     But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.     ""It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement,"" said Wolf.     Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.     A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.     In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.     Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said.     Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.     In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered.     But government officials said last night, ""We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.""     They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial markets, government officials said.  REUTER "

Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in bilateral trade by 1990.

trade,"Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.     The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said.     The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact.     In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.     But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a ""clear indication"" that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods.     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter.     MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.     Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.     ""The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business,"" said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.     But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult.     ""The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products. They're well supplied here,"" said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.     The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills, the analysts said.     ""The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,"" said Edwards.     A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd HIT.T>, said the firm's reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.     Company officials unveiled the following plans -     - NEC Corp NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter.      In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before.     - Hitachi Ltd's HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low.     - Toshiba Corp TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.     Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan.     - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said ""boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand.""     - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.     - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five billion yen, a company official said.  REUTER "

crude,"CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said.     CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.     In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.     A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.     The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.  REUTER "

Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are problems ""they have brought on themselves.""     The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.     ""Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan,"" he said. ""My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan.""

We don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include ""some difficult items on the agenda.""     Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.     Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries, undercutting U.S. Products, he said.

The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.     Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed.     Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.     The officials also said they expect the government's new trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese companies to set up production facilities overseas.     Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are dealing with. MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan's trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year.  REUTER "
coffee,"Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said.     No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said.     Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March.     Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.     ""The situation is unchanged,"" consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. ""As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting.""     At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using ""objective criteria,"" which would likely have reduced Brazil's share.     Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table.     ""As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags,"" he told Reuters.     Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.     The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.     There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said.     The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today's session, delegates said.  Reuter "

gnp,"The Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December.     WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.     A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.     Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.     Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2 pct last year due to the slack economic activity.     Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's central bank, last month forecast the current account would be roughly in balance this year.     However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9 pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he said.  REUTER "

gnp,"Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.     It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries.     A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.     A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.     Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.     Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes.     It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988.     Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment.     The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.     It added Australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.  REUTER "
sugar,"Representatives of U.S. sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good.     Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association, said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states, California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota.     Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln acres sown last year.     USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S. sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.     The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are ""just awful,"" said Carter.     In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association.     ""The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,"" Markwart said.     In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.     USDA's report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.     Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze. Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year, cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.     In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year, but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields, said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association.     The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.     The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings, particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.     ""We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years,"" said Godfrey, adding that the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.     Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.     At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat speculative position limits unchanged.     ""Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest,"" Michael Braude, president of the Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.     A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT's limits.     KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators.     The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.

crude,"Exxon Corp said in its annual report that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace all oil and gas produced.     The company said that it added about four pct to production bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.     The company said that the average price for oil and gas declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38 pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.     Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986 fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from oil sands in Canada.     Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe and the Far East.     But capital expenditures for exploration and production were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year and further reductions were expected in 1987.     Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached a new high of 422,000 bpd.     The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded over the past several years.     The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to earnings gains from refining and marketing.     Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs in 1985.     The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043 mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.     Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500 mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes to extract higher proportions of light products.

trade,"China's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a top European Community official said.     Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the European Communities, told a news conference that China's application would involve long and difficult negotiations.     China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in February presented a memorandum backing its application, which De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be presented to China.     ""After China, other important state-trading countries including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession. China's application could be considered a test case,"" he said.     He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.     Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.     De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current Socialist GATT members.     On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange shortage would force China to import less this year and next than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital.

Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC export licensing policies.     The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.     But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer already lodged with intervention boards of different European countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already cleared quality specifications.     The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the sugar.

Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.     The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say.     The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.     However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery.  Reuter "
trade,"The Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Suggested that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone make efforts to present ""advanced' proposals on trade issues when he visits Washington next month.     Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone, Kyodo News Service said.     Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues.     Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport project, and a new international telecommunications firm.     Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for Nakasone's visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5.     Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy, ""I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended."" Nakasone did not elaborate.     The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact.     Meanwhile, Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project, party sources said.     The LDP international economic affairs council was responding to Nakasone's request for measures to reduce Japan's increasing trade surpluses with the U.S. And Europe, they said.  REUTER "

In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year.     He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north.     Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added.     The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley.     Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields.     The officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.  Reuter "

trade,"French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues.     French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.     But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said.     France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons.     Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: ""Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.""     Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.     In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).     ""This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,"" Reagan said at the signing ceremony.      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.     The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries.      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as ""America's oldest ally in war and peace.""      ""I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,"" Chirac replied.     But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress.

Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington.     The U.S. official described the idea as a ""grain producers' OPEC"" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration's desire to lessen government intervention in trade.

They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3 and four mln barrels.     Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower.     For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged.     API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.     The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.     Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27.     API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by less than one pct for the week ended March 27.

trade,"The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.     But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a ""bear"" market.     ""It's the billion dollar question,"" said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London.     Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit.    And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets.     ""A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,"" said O'Brien. ""Now, it is much less certain.""     Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.     Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  ""We're still in a bull market,"" adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and ""The bear usually strikes slowly.""     Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.     Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.     He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark.     In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.  REUTER "

In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency said The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisture for early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas, and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have washed out some rice fields requiring replanting.      Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil moisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start due to earlier dryness, it said.     In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat in the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing crop moisture requirements, it said.

Noting that there are ""enormous pressures in the Congress and the land"" for the United States to take a tough stand, he said, ""This was a case where we felt we simply had to act.""     Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was ""well considered by this administration and not taken lightly.""     While the White House official held open the possibility that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions.

Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.     He also said he did not think there would be a trade war with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the United States to risk such a war.     ""Those fears are unfounded,"" he said.     He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.     Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some effect.     Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop in the market to trade sanctions were ""barking up the wrong tree.""     He said the market observers will realize this shortly.

grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine eligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under 1987 farm programs.     Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how many persons would be involved in their farming operations.     Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1 from March 1, Sitter said.     ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at county ASCS offices.     Hertz said ASCS county officials ""have had to make a large number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap.""     ""These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the large number of applications for both the 1987 farm programs and the Conservation Reserve Program,"" Hertz said.  Reuter "

grain,"The U.S. grain planting intentions and stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.     The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are ""the first report we've had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody,"" said John ""Bud"" Frazier, grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.     ""I'm really excited about it,"" Frazier said.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.     The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels of wheat, all below trade guesses.     Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports.     Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel ""if the bell rang right now.""     ""We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and soybeans) than we thought we had,"" he said, noting that hog and poultry production is up.     ""We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"" said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter.     However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption.     She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.     ""We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's opening,"" she said.     Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from last year's 8.25 billion bushels.     ""We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks,"" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6.7 billion bushels.     Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term, ""But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices.""     Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans.     The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.     ""There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we're working under today, and this report should reinforce that,"" Frazier said.     ""We are seeing the program beginning to work,"" said Meyer.  Reuter "
interest,"Quarter-point prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.     ""Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but no rush is likely,"" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.     Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.     McCulley said that once the spread between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.     However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example, the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year.     Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.     ""The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.     Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon.     Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.     ""The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,"" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.     In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a ""pass.""     ""The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change,"" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.      She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase.     The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise ""may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.""     Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to developing countries, large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.     The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.     In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.       The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct.     Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.     But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.  Reuter "
grain,"""If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on.""     Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.     China has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable.     Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986.     But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.     Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years.     ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up.""     ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added.     The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year.     ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures.     ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient.""     An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government.    The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops.     To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.     Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.     Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city grain prices without any problem.     But the government has ruled out a price rise. ""Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability,"" said a China Daily editorial this month.     The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. ""We must be very careful. We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises,"" he said. ""The problem is how to do it.""     The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents.     In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.     The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.     Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.     ""As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future,"" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.     Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative.     ""New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment,"" the newspaper said.  REUTER "
grain,"The grain output of a major Chinese grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain, the province's vice-governor said.     The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui, as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.     Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.     He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.     He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports.     The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct.     ""With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production,"" he said.     On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the northeast, but it imports wheat.     ""Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered adequate,"" Tian said.  REUTER "

A department official attributed the increase to growing domestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is expected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a year earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.     Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to rise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year earlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.     The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to climb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987 from 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the first quarter of this year.     Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with the U.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly 50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said.     He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains, machinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To rise sharply because of government efforts to balance trade with Washington.

interest,"The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said.     But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.     ""Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,"" he said. ""The money market rates are the important ones.""     Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations.     An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation, braking the expansion of money supply.     ""Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time,"" he added.     Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy, since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.     Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.     After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the economy should show an uptrend in the last three. ""We don't believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a 'growth dip,'"" Seipp said.     But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.     The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth.     Seipp added the federal government should make ""further courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility.""  Reuter "

Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth both at 7.9 pct.     The government's GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct, the same level it had set for 1986.     The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6 dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.     Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled municipal expenditures in the early part of the year.

ship,"Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986 because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products, industry sources said.     Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344 vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt), up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told Reuters.     China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.     Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, ""We expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected decline in our steel product exports.""     Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.     Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.     Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.     The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.     In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan remained stable during the same period, he added.     ""We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China because foreign importers have switched their purchases,"" he said.     Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987 from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.

Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.     Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2 pct, the level at beginning of 1987.     The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, he said.     The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today, with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however, fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of increased liquidity for a local stock issue.  REUTER "

gold,"A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference.     ""If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added.     ""How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?"" he said.     The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.     The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.     However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.     Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.     A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.     Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.     While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.     Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.     Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said.     Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant.     Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said.     ""All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"" Hofer said.     ""I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,"" he added.     Officials of several major Japanese trading houses, attending the press conference, said they supported Credit Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.  REUTER "

New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five.     Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished.     Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.     There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.     A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.     Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange, opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing of 1,012.50 rupees.     A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5 pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.     ""But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks pay for deposits of similar maturity,"" a merchant banker said.  REUTER "

gold,"The climate for precious metals is improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets, brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.

In March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.     The supply/demand position has improved in the past year, and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.

interest,"Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday, dealers said.     They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks.     G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.     Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2 pct, the level at beginning of 1987.     The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, he said.     The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today, with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however, fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of increased liquidity for a local stock issue.  REUTER "

interest,"The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said.     Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4 pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.     Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news.     Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.     Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit.     ""The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,"" said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

coffee,"International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman Lindenberg Sette said.     The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive board's regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.     Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated.     Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most countries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September council session to restart negotiations.     Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market situation, the producer delegates said.     The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices in London and New York futures, traders said.

gnp,"Kenya's economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.     He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors.     Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector.     The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, Ouko said.     This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added.     ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the planning minister said.     ""High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade liberalisation and disciplined financial management are expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" he said.     Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February, the minister added.     Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now.     Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops increased during the second half of last year.     Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period, he said.     Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy and promised to improve government cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact with them.     ""I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same period the previous year,"" he said.     Ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulate investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved in processing applications.     The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.     This was owing to higher agricultural production and the Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major currencies, the report said.     The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during the period.     This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of 780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period, compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in the second half of 1985, it said.

soybean,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a  case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.

The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice.

wheat,"Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.     Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.     Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.     Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer.     Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S. Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer.     But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.     Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.     Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out.     Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks.     Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials.     Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S. Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month.     Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.     Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.     As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price.     Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices far above world market prices.     The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism, grain trade sources said.     Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U.S. housewives.     The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.     In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.     However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer.     Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.     Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets.     That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

wheat,"Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.     Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.     Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.  Reuter "

coffee,"The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters.     Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they said.     Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted.     Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.     Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded.     The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said.     Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said.     ""With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,"" one leading producer delegate said.     Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop.     Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said.     Guatemala has already proposed the ""other oilds"" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares.     Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of ""objective criteria"" favoured by consumers.     At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.     A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause.     The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak.     The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on ""objective criteria.""     ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September.     Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said.     They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure.     Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.     Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said.     The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said.  Reuter "

corn,"The U.S. Has been promised a near monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an EC official said.     The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement.     Under the accord, which began in January, third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as 300,000 tonnes of sorghum.     However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.     The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.     EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from outside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable terms than that from the U.S.     No Commission spokesman was immediately available for comment.

interest,"Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue.     Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.     Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient.     The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.     Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.     Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.     Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries.     But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first.     Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.  REUTER "

dlr,"The dollar's recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said.     Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said.     ""Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention,"" said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention.     After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.     By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.     ""They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win,"" said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.     The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord.     Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances.     Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries.     For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.     Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. ""It's been pro-forma intervention,"" said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.     Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.     ""It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels),"" said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation.     ""There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars,"" added ""Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it.""     Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.     Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. ""I don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies.""     Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market.     Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group.     There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide.     Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered.     ""In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"" one senior official in Tokyo said.  Reuter "

grain,"Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said.     They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops.     The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.     The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.     The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.     In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay.     In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.     The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.     Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.     The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.     Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces.     The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.     The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.     The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting.     Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production.     The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.     The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.     The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.     The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.     The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.     These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.     The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.     Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further.     The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season.     Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.  Reuter "

interest,"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit card to 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billing statement.     The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each transaction.     A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a substantial cut in credit card rates ""was a factor"" in the move, but he would not elaborate.     Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not voluntarily act.     The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said ""the bank card market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay competitive.""

coffee,"New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.     Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda.     Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.     ""Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,"" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. ""But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.""     ""At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,"" O'Neill added. ""Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.""     ""I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,"" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.     A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.     Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall.     Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand.     Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon.     ""Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,"" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.     Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and ""this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.""     Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June.     Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year.     Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season.     But Elders O'Neill said, ""The roasters are not overstocked by any means.""     Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.  Reuter "
gas,"U.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump.      ""We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,"" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD).     U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy.     ""Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?"" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp AN>. ""If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position.""     But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.     ""Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won't solve our problems and could well compound them,"" said Swearingen. ""Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going to be subverted by government,"" he added.      William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.      Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is  controversal but might work, said Dunham.     Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports.     ""Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum CNP>.      An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham said.      ""The energy security issue should be considered when environmental issues are considered,"" Martin said.     ""The level of investment for the proposed lowering of sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is unacceptable,"" Dunham said. ""Most companies cannot afford it.""     George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these proposals ""will place pressure on small refining operations and promote further industry consolidation.""      An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.      The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct.      Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies.     ""What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?"" asked Dunham. ""A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,"" Dunham said.      This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.      Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months.      ""We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp DIA>.      Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said.      ""This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,"" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.  Reuter "

grain,"The Soviet Union would likely be more interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S. wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.     Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.     ""Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here. But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.     Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels, Moscow would likely buy more, he said.     ""If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I expect they'll take it,"" said Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.     McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer.     Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter ""they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than normal,"" McMinimy said.

interest,"After an already steep fall in the past week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term, financial analysts said.     However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline.     Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar, they said.     ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.     The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.     ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar, foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over,"" Gibbs said.     The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.     Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.     ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee and McGinley Inc.     Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said.     Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.     Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months, he said.     In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit oversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.     Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.     Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.     ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said.     If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984.

coffee,"Coffee futures dipped further today and closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years.     Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981.      Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas.     The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.     Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.     Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests.     In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.     ""This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,"" she said.     Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said.     Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

coffee,"Coffee futures dipped further and closed below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years.     Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981.      Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas.     The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.     Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.     Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests.     In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.     ""This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,"" she said.     Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.

Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices.     Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses.     Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower.     Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year.     Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected.  Reuter "
grain,"The U.S. House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.     The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.     In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said.     The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988.     The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now.     Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate.     The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action.     The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.     Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.     Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.     Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland.     The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports.     Other miscellaneous amendments included:     -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports.     -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.     -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.     -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year.     -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.     -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

coffee,"Thai coffee exporters said they hoped the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices.     Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports.     Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said.     The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.     Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the previous year.     However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.     Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices.     He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.  REUTER "
trade,"Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.     Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions, an official said.     Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in April 1983.     Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct, equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.     Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.     However, the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And European demand.     ""Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S., Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties,"" one said.     But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus, which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.

grain,"Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.     ""Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications,"" the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.     ""Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia,"" it said.     The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.     Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.     It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping.     Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said.     The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat.     The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment.     ""It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored,"" it said.     For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria.     Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.     The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained.     An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

sugar,"The maximum rebate granted at yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the commission accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set too low.     The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.     London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.     Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the remainder being rejected as of too low quality.     The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it.     They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet, adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to review commission policy before making up their minds.     The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of the new season in July.

A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd FSCN.J>.     The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the affected shaft because of what the company described as ""the creation of unsafe working conditions.""

interest,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said.     But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.     In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.     Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this.     The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these.     Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson.     But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.     Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, ""the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue.""     Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, ""there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement.""     He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct.     ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said.     Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.     ""Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,"" one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said.     Capel's Skeoch said, ""it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at.""     ""It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time,"" Skeoch said.     Brett said, ""we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.""     Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.     Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.     ""Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe,"" Dunn said.     ""It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,"" he said.     Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.     ""Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators,"" Capel's Skeoch said.     Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.  REUTER "

Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.     Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the spectre of a trade war between the two countries.

Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy.     Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should also be used to stimulate the economy.     Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.     The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.     Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates.     Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.

""The sanctions are against the free trade system,"" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: ""If these measures are taken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would become not so good as before.""     Other officials were more blunt. ""The U.S. Action will have a significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),"" another MITI official said.     A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters the U.S. Threats have undercut those in the government who argue for conciliation.     ""There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should we bother doing anything,"" he said. ""Anything we do, we will be bashed.""     The senior official sounded pessimistic about the likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S. Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington on April 29.     ""I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden (by the visit),"" he said.     Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of measures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustration over Japan's large trade surplus.     But the senior official played down those expectations.  REUTER "
trade,"Japan is doing all it can to solve its trade problems with the United States but the two nations will remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in Japan's favour, a senior official said.     ""So long as there is an external imbalance there will be trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,"" the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.     Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.     Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the spectre of a trade war between the two countries.     ""We take the current situation very seriously,"" said the official, who declined to be identified. ""The basic stance of the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all available resources.""     The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer microchips in world markets and to try to import more American semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.     The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs in the middle of this month. But he said that any response would be in accordance with international law and Japan's international obligations.     He added that both Japan and the United States must take account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the world economy.  REUTER "

coffee,"Coffee producers belonging to the ""Other Milds"" group will meet May 4 in Guatemala to discuss the possibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates told reporters after the closing session of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting.     The ""Other Milds"" group, comprising Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea and Peru, might consult with Brazil and Colombia on this meeting, but it was not certain whether these two countries would attend, they said.     The ICO board meeting ended without moves to restart negotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producer delegates said.     Producers are expected to hold other consultations in the coming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but no date for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.

trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement to the Senate Finance Committee.     ""In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S. restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for global liberalization,"" Yeutter said.     Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending trade bill.     Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S. competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid provoking foreign retaliation.     He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.     Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.

Speaking at the Agriculture Department to representatives of the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association, Lyng said some dairymen asked the program be extended.     But he said the Reagan administration, which opposed the whole herd buyout program in the 1985 farm bill, would not agree to an extension.     The program begun in early 1986, is to be completed this summer. U.S. cattlemen bitterly opposed the scheme, complaining that increased dairy cow slaughter drove cattle prices down last year.

trade,"The European Community responded to widespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishing an extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to EC exports.     A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed 25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to a similar document issued by U.S. Administration officials in November, and updated a previous EC list.     EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken by trading partners of the U.S. And that ""the U.S. Were not innocents in the matter.""     The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.     The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations, and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming international trade talks. ""The purpose of the report is to make clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face similar problems in the U.S.,"" it said.     Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup, certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and machine tools.     It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports. The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancement program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of 9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8 mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.     ""The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S. EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will continue to do so,"" it said, adding the current GATT round would also provide an opportunity to address the subject.     The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S. On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and certain cottons, restrict EC exports.     In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers, standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S. Administration's ""buy American"" public procurement policy.  Reuter "
livestock,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding  import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist response in the United States.     ""Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might be very serious,"" Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.     Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand ""total elimination"" of the beef import quota by April 1988.     The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.     Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the semiconductor dispute.     ""They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us,"" Lyng said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan has more to lose in a trade war than the United States.     Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice in food purchases.     He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as well.     Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm products, principally grains and soybeans.  Reuter "
trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he doubted Japan could avoid the April 17 imposition of U.S. tariffs on its semiconductor products.     The three high-level Japanese government representatives who would be coming here in the next few days to discuss the issue would probably be unable to show evidence of continued compliance with the semiconductor trade agreement, Yeutter told reporters.     ""It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliance with the agreement"" based on sales of only a few days time, he said.     Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certain for April 17, he said, ""One could never foreclose all options. We have an obligation to listen to the arguments our trading partners make.""     He said the length of the sanctions will be determined by Japan and Japanese semiconductor firms.     ""They would be lifted only when persuasive evidence provided demonstrates compliance,"" he said.     ""Whether a few weeks or a few months depends on their actions,"" Yeutter added.  Reuter "

Steeg also said it would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by imposing a discriminatory tariff, permitting retaliation by oil exporting countries.     Steeg praised President Reagan's opposition to a tax, which would be aimed at helping the U.S. oil industry.  Reuter "

Speaking to representatives of the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association, NCA, Lyng attacked what he called recent ""terribly biased"" press reports critical of USDA poultry inspection. He cited a report on CBS ""60 Minutes"" which criticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry.     ""I know we have the finest meat and poultry inspection system in the world,"" Lyng told the cattlemen.     Lyng said USDA makes every effort to minimize the levels of salmonella in poultry, but added ""the total elimination of harmful bacteria is virtually impossible in this world.""  Reuter "
trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said a possible recession in western Europe or Japan was possible as a result of the U.S. dollar's decline and the resulting drop in the U.S. trade deficit.     Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee, ""They certainly have the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust"" to the U.S. reduction in imports.     Asked if the U.S. trade deficit was preventing them from going into a recession, Yeutter replied that result was ""certainly possible"" and was the reason why they should adjust their monetary, fiscal and tax policies.     Asked by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) whether the U.S. trade deficit would improve more if the value of the dollar dropped further, Yeutter replied, ""That should be a mathematical truism."" But he added that markets are more complicated than that.     He said he expected the current decline in the dollar to show up soon in the decline in the value of imports.     He expected the U.S. would soon start importing less from Japan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe where there's less rigidity on imports.  Reuter "

interest,"Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies.     The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added.     In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed ""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates.     Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS).     Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving ""more or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.     Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said.     But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""I think agreement is quite possible,"" he said.      Eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries.     ""It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content,"" he said.     He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies.     ""A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said.     Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies.     He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a ""system of tentative (fluctuation) margins.""     He added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it.     Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system.     ""That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods (the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended,"" he said.     The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks.     He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes.     Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement of the EMS. ""Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community,"" he said.  REUTER "

coffee,"Coffee prices look set to continue sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota accord, according to coffee traders and analysts.     Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage, they said.     The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.     Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market recovered from yesterday's ""confidence blip,"" one trader commented.     But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future, one trade source said.     The market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he said.     Technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the 1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a ""three figure mentality,"" and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological 1,000 stg level, he added.     Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export registrations.      This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.     However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of Brazil's frost season, they said.     Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers, they added.     Central American producers have sold the bulk of their current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment, and this could pressure prices further, traders said.     However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be bullish, advised caution. ""Everybody's bearish now, just as they were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,"" he said.     Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels. ""One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers -- there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.""     While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September 1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices.     ""Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that at this stage,"" a General Foods spokesman said.     Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65 stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.     Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future.     ""The market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn't look set to go much lower,"" a Nestle spokesman commented.     Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per kilo for medium quality, traders added.  Reuter "

crude,"Amoco Corp first quarter profits are expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share, reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow said.     Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331 mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's first quarter.     Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first quarter refining and marketing results ""will look pretty poor,"" because of low margins in January and February. The margins began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added.     Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good for the rest of the year, ""but it remains to be seen if they will match 1986 levels."" The Amoco chairman said he expects crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will hold.     Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is 21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration spending.     President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop in oil and gas prices.     Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from 27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve estimate by four pct.     Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas liquids production to decline about five pct this year from last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made last year when oil prices were falling.     He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per day to the company's 1987 U.S. production.     Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free gasoline, especially the higher octane grades.     He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor pressure will further tighten the industry's gasoline production capacity.  Reuter "

sugar,"An amendment approved by the House Agriculture Committee yesterday requiring quotas on U.S. imports of products containing sugar is unlikely to remain in a comprehensive trade bill, Congressional sources said.

Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbing shipments of food products containing sugar from Canada. However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overall jurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill the amendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.     An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposal probably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees. But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send a warning to U.S. companies considering moving food processing plants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.     In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland and other supporters said the proposal would have no effect on the status of foreign trade zones.     Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment on sugar-containing products because they believe sugar is being shipped to the United States in food products as a way to circumvent the quota on raw sugar.     The sugar quota is only one mln short tons this year.  Reuter "
gas,"The Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules to shield water supplies from potential leaks from 1.4 mln underground storage tanks, nearly half of which are used to store gasoline at service stations.     It said the rules would require owners and operators of the tanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardous chemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks, to notify appropriate authorities.     The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also be financially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said.     It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will be proposed later.     Hazardous tanks are regulated separately.     EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said ""Thousands of underground storage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequate controls, many more can be expected to leak in the future, endangering our nation's drinking-water supplies.""

interest,"There is little scope for a substantial increase in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said Federal National Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.     Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association, Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime  rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.     ""I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. If anything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than to tighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of the economy are showing weakness,"" Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buys mortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.     Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last two years had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A one pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18 cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.     Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out other sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.     ""There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of the long-term debt market,"" he said. Both home mortgage debt and long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual rates of about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of 442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

coffee,"Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream, Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the supermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz for national-brand ""gourmet"" coffees.     General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and P, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the only two national brand roasters so far to introduce the higher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.     But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in regular ground roast types.     ""I would suspect General Foods will make a name for themselves with their gourmet line,"" said a coffee trade source. ""What it could do is really dent the small-store, whole-bean business,"" the trade source added.     The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic advertising composite--the ""yuppie"" consumer.     They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and were ""first on their block with a wok,"" as described by Karin Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee, called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.     Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described its potential appeal as ""a status thing.""     At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in small specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate, according to an A and P executive.     Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has ""nothing to announce at this point"" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and fourth size market spot by volume with A and P.     Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of General Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market takes off.     General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a 1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show no signs of picking up.     Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee quality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.     ""The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this was quality coffee,"" Gallant said.     As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, ""they turn around and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a Coke',"" he said.     Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd -- the yuppie composite.     ""Where else are you going to go?,"" an industry source said. ""Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are no other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is gourmet,"" he said.     In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular ground roast coffees produce.     Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell coffee near the trade price as a ""loss leader,"" a product designed to draw shoppers into the store.     But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a special valve designed to keep the beans fresher.     Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet coffee are now almost three times the price of green.     Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference. General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market surveys for Private Collection came back for more.     And product manager Brown points to the success of more expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in restricted high income areas and are now available in almost every supermarket in the country.     A and P is similarly optimistic. ""We think we'll do extremely well in the gourmet market,"" Gallant said.     Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

grain,"Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture Department and industry commodity analysts said.     ""The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in balance,"" a USDA analyst said.     The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.     Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in stocks, analysts said.     ""It's a substantially different story from last year when we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,"" Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.     Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here, McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields, final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.     McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in 1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile of 5.45 billion bushels.     ""To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're at least in a holding pattern,"" George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for Pillsbury said.     Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of 1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to ""significantly less"" domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.     USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next year's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.     ""We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now, so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage reductions, that would be an improvement,"" an Agriculture Department wheat analyst said.     Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to 100 mln bushels, analysts said.     As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs will be more effective because they will force more high producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.     ""We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long tunnel,"" the analyst said.  Reuter "

The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, with May settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2 dlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs. But unlike in the past when lower prices slowed country movement, now lower county prices widen the differentials with the corn loan and make PIK-and-roll even more attractive, they noted.  Reuter "

cpi,"Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review.     It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.     The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry.     The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.     Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.     Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.     The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters.     It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.

sugar,"The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.     Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report.    ""And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added.     The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.     Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.     Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.     Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes.     However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said.     Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.     A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said.     The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency.     As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.     Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market.     Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added.  REUTER "

gnp,"Spain has revised some of its main economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its monthly bulletin.     Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a previous target of 3.5 pct.     Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.     The forecast for private consumption growth remains unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.     Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.     Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from 5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the dollar and slack external demand.     Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.     The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last week on whether this target could be maintained if wage settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended five pct ceiling.     Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases agreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wage settlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5 pct estimated by the employers' federation CEOE.  REUTER "
sugar,"French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.     The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.     Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention.     But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.     European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.     Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it.     A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries.     Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes.     Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said.     Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction.     Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.     Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future.     One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.

grain,"Japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market, while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture, a government report said.     The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.     Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food.     Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.     The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.     The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.     The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said.     This could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure, the paper said.     To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said.

trade,"Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.     The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets.     Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance.     Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.     The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.     Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states.     The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries.     ""There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reagan administration official said.     He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.     The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems.     The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems.     At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.     The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself,  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies.     These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties.     In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries.     The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources.     The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said.     The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.     There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system.     At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries.     The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.     The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination.     As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.     Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations.     Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects.     The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared.  Reuter "

The Soviets also secured a 34,000 tonner from Gibraltar for a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,500 dlrs daily and a 61,000 tonner for similar business at 6,750 dlrs daily.     Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be connected with Soviet grain, including a 69,000 tonner from Taranto for five to seven months at 6,500 dlrs daily. Similar fixing was reported yesterday at 6,000 dlrs.     Other timecharter fixing included a 14,000 tonner from Indonesia to the U.S. Gulf at 2,800 dlrs daily and a combined carrier of 75,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf to Italy at 9,000 dlrs daily.     Severel vessels were booked from Antwerp-Hamburg range, including a 61,000 tonner bound for Singapore-Japan at 7,500 dlrs daily and a 16,000 tonner destined for west coast India at 5,000 dlrs.     Grain fixing was much quieter out of the U.S. Gulf, with no fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent or Japan, although tonnage was secured for at least five small corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25 dlrs.

He said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000 tonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this month and added that Greece, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium were considering imports of Spanish flour for milling.     Market sources said the corn exports, the absence of imports from the rest of the EC and the delay in shipments of corn from the U.S. Had pushed domestic corn prices up by around 0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday.

wheat,"Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.     No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said.     Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable.     The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops.     Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds.     The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said.     Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln.     He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly.     The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.     The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes.     Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.     The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said.     The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.     Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.     Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.     The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.     Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.     Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran.  Reuter "

wheat,"The European Commission's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.     Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted.     The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.     The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission. There has been growing concern that rising internal prices, triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in interior markets.     The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June.     News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged.     Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market. However, some traders believe these figures are overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores.     A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes.     Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.     This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August.     The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season.     Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.     The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders said.     Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.     The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.  Reuter "
gnp,"Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986, according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.     Total investment this year, the country's second as a member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct, again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.     It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.     Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.     Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and 6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.     The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy.     The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986.     The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year, especially in the construction and public works sectors.     Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost investment last year, the bank said.

trade,"U.S. and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.     But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.     The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties would be retroactive to March 31.     Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.

Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources said.     Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions.     Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc, government officials said.     But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added.  Reuter "
trade,"World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world.     But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war.     Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth.     ""We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time,"" he said.     He said the U.S. action against Japan was ""a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.""     The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.     Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched.     He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.     The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy.     ""We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"" Conable said.     He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time.     He noted, ""the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.""     Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank.     Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks.     He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency.     the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities.     ""I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow,"" Conable said.     However, he said ""I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.""     He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis.     Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues.     On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that ""I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.""     He added, ""so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution.""     On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa.     Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.  Reuter "

crude,"Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said.     They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct.     On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs.     ""This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,"" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.     Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said.     ""But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,"" Gobert commented.     The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986.     Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.     Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.     Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. ""However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,"" analyst Plexman said.     ""Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"" he added.     Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs.     But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed.     Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices.     However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.     Shell Canada and Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.     ""The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,"" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.     ""While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,"" Texaco Canada added.     In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work.     ""The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.     Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.     The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.     Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said.     ""For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,"" Maciej said.

grain,"Rising demand for U.S. rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31.     Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year, the report said.     USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off.     With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate, USDA said.     ""Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers,"" USDA said.     USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S.     ""The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said.     World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes, increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains.     China, India and South Korea have increased output, while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s, the report said.  Reuter "

livestock,"Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived.     For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork.""     Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product.     Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.     Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said.     USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products.     Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.  Reuter "

gnp,"President Alan Garcia said he sought to deepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank.     In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. ""We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt,"" he said.     Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.     But tonight Garcia said: ""We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us.""     The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr debt.     Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.     He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.     Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements.     He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective.     Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up, he said, without specifying the amount.     Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate.     The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.     To encourage private investment, he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government.     He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government.  REUTER "
crude,"Oil output in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05 mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources said.     The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72 dlrs.     The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of 800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.     Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the sources added.     Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.     The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it Murban.     Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on stream in 1983, to be test production not included in calculations for complying with the OPEC quota.     Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its quota in March, the sources added.  REUTER "
sugar,"The southwest Chinese region of Guangxi increased its production of sugarcane by 26.8 pct to 9.4 mln tonnes in the 1986-87 crushing season (November to March) from the previous year, the New China News Agency said.     The cane, grown on 206,000 hectares, yielded 1.04 mln tonnes of refined sugar, it said without giving comparative figures.     China's sugar output in calendar 1986 rose to 5.24 mln tonnes from 4.45 mln in calendar 1985, official figures show. An official newspaper said in January that output in the 1986/87 crushing season would be only 4.82 mln tonnes because of a drop in acreage due to low profits on growing cane and beet.  REUTER "

ship,"Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported.     The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned.     The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said.     The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz.     It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq.     U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying.     From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said.  REUTER "
crude,"Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.     Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.     The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.     IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.     It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period.     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted.     Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.     Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.  REUTER "
gnp,"The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said.     The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct.     An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly.     New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc PBI> said ""the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement.""     Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.     Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct.     The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant.     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.     The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.  Reuter "

IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year.

Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March.     And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said.     As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.  Reuter "

grain,"The failure of the Bangladesh government to tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a famine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda Zia, told a press conference yesterday.     Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country in March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat sales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.     Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-April will ease the situation. ""Temporary grain shortage in the arid north and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at this time of the year,"" one official said.     Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and failure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis.

trade,"The U.S. Administration, under Congressional pressure to cut the trade deficit, will urge Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington, monetary sources said.     The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the 1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the Paris Accord are more binding, they said.     Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect U.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast enough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the meeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, the sources said.     ""The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to announce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan and for the exchange markets in general,"" one of the sources said.     Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, in which West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will be renewed by the industrial countries this week.     Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made setting up stimulus measures.     The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a further substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with Congress this year, the sources said.     Washington would like its economic partners to establish specific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the set objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on appropriate corrective action, they added.     The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports and the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing its demand for imports.     But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck, the sources said.     Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods.     One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings.     Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures, aimed particularly at Japan, has strengthened, the sources said.  REUTER "
crude,"Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a production sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra.     It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.     The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.     Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years.     The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.     A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible.     The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.     Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted.     Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil.     Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day.  REUTER "
crude,"Japanese oil traders generally expect oil prices to remain steady through June, when the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting is scheduled to take place.     Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly resist paying official prices, trade sources said.     Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.     Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month, mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its 15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.     However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.     Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting from Japanese buyers.     The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.     Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East Economic Survey estimated.     ""Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to destroy the market,"" an oil trader in Tokyo said.     Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.     The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20 to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be weaker, traders said.     Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

sugar,"Indonesia has imported 12,000 tonnes of refined sugar from Cuba to meet consumer demand in the province of South Sulawesi, the head of the provincial food agency said.     The imported sugar was needed because two of three sugar refineries in the province have been temporarily shut down. It arrived in the provincial capital of Ujungpandang today and will be distributed to markets in the province, the food agency official said.     Indonesia used to be a sugar exporter but last year it imported 162,500 tonnes of sugar from Thailand, Angola and Brazil to bolster its depleted stocks.     Indonesia's sugar cane production last year was expected to rise significantly but domestic sugar consumption has soared because of rising demand by the food processing industry, the head of the food logistics agency, Bustanil Arifin, has said.     The government has forecast that sugar production in calendar 1987 would increase 30.2 pct to 2.59 mln tonnes from 1.99 mln in 1986 but industry sources doubt whether the target could be met due to persistent post-harvest handling and transport problems.

trade,"A top Japanese businessman said the country's four largest economic organizations will soon present to the government a set of proposals to expand domestic demand.     Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), told a news conference the government should draw up a package of economic measures totalling more than 5,000 billion yen.     Saito said the government's package should include plans to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products and to lift tariffs on industrial products.     Leading industrialised countries should also step up concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates, Saito said.     The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Employers' Association, the Japan Committee for Economic Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

crude,"Indonesian Energy minister Subroto said he was very confident of continued stability in the oil market because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a price of 18 dlrs a barrel.     ""We are very confident that things will continue this way.

He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to firm slightly in the third quarter of the year.     He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so that members could produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said.     Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan.

The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.     Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate.     Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.     ""The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy,"" Smith said.     ""Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak, or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.""     He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies.     Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.     ""We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,"" he said.

Combining long and short term capital outflows, West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.     The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.     Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said.     Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted, the February current account surplus narrowed against January.     While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct.     In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January.     The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget.  REUTER "
grain,"The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June, Commission sources said.     They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.     However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later.     The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.     However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval.     The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted.     Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market.     This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.  Reuter "

trade,"Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said.     The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said.     ""Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry,"" analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.     But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.     Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs.     ""We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers.     ""Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching,"" Kurlack added.     Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the U.S.     The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market.     But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.     As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.     ""The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle,"" analyst Peck said.     The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers.     ""I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,"" industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.     But analyst Peck said, ""it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production.""     He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.

ship,"Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said.     The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new ""Silkworm"" missiles at superpower flags.     The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf.     ""They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil,"" one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.     The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.     U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

grain,"The use of generic commodity certificates, or ""certs,"" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.     Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.     However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.     Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.     In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.     When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government, Amstutz said, ""GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs"" of the certificate program.     Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures.     GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.     ""There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,"" Amstutz said.     Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs, he said.     Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range market-oriented farm policy, he said.     Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed.  Reuter "

grain,"More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.     The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989,  Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.     Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.     The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a ""zero certificate case,"" where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled ""adequate certificate case"" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.     The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct.     Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.     For the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.     The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.     The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined.     The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash.

sugar,"New immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S. Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress, sources on Capitol Hill said.     USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities.     The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the New York Times reported yesterday.     Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,"" Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.     Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said.     Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry.     A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was ""marginal.""     In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees ""a tough call,"" this source said.     USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month.     While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said.     The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.     Congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply for temporary, then permanent, resident status.  Reuter "

Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.     ""Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong,"" Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.     Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.     Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot.     Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.     Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said.     Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.     Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies.     In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said.     Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.     Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week.     The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.     Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies.     Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals.     However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year.

trade,"A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.     At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations.     The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy.     Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds.     Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, ""I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.""     ""I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill,"" he added.     Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour.  Reuter "
dlr,"Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth.     In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.""     He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament.     But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.     ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,"" he said.     Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.     ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.     He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States.     Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.     ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,"" he said.     But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot.  REUTER "

ship,"Australian trade unions said they have launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New South Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce injury compensation payments.     Union sources said talks with the state government broke down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later today in an attempt to find a compromise.     Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's most populous state were the first to be affected, and union officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless there is a quick settlement.     The state government recently introduced a new workers' compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary ratification.     NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers' compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.     Union officials said industrial action could spread to other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp cuts in workers' compensation.  REUTER "
trade,"Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.     They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.     But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain.     The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.     Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.     ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd MC.T>.     ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker James Capel and Co>.     In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.     ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.     Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.     The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.     ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters Taiwan Safe Group>.     A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan.     Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.     In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.     ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.     ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.     The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.     The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.     ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,"" Button said.     He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country.     Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue.     Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.     The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year.     They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.

crude,"The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

Thailand's improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products.     The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices.     The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion.     Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct.

trade,"Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.     ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named, said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,"" he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official said.  REUTER "
trade,"South Korea's trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus ""at a proper level.""     But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.     The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.     ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.     Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia.     ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.     Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.     ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he said.     Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners, particularly the United States.     ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level,"" Kim said.  REUTER "
gas,"Finland's national oil company Neste Oy NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton, Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.     The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.     The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.     The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.     The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead.     Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added.     Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said.     Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.     The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said.  REUTER "

Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.     ""There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues,"" he said.

interest,"Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said.     High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.     Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.     A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.     Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States.     ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said.     ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money.""     The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.     ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?""     But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said.     ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14.     While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.     ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.     Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.     ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.     Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.     Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes off the yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.     Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen.     Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.     Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector.     The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period.     The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field.     Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought.     ""They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.  REUTER "
gnp,"Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is important.""     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.

trade,"Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves for Washington today with data he hopes will refute U.S. Charges Japan has violated a pact on microchip trade.     A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.     But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. ""I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation,"" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.     Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces. ""The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time,"" he said.     Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.     He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week's talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.  REUTER "

Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports said, and replied: ""...It is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described.""     Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.     ""There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues,"" he said.     ""The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation,"" he said.

sugar,"Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.     As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.     Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said.     The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  REUTER "

Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.     Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce this year.     The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction against the redundancies on procedural grounds.     The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.     Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the sector, said.     The employers have written to the union asking it to reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been called for tomorrow.  Reuter "
sugar,"A total 118,350 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said.     Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.

sugar,"Roughly half of this year's expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters.     Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added.     ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start,"" he said.     Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A"" and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.     This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.     Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  Reuter "

grain,"The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.     ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.  Reuter "
grain,"Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  Reuter "

grain,"Storage problems with Brazil's record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  Reuter "

trade,"Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports.     Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.     The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.     They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers.     Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.     President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement.     In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.""     Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.     Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.     About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.     Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.     Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.     He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.     ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""     He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.  Reuter "

livestock,"The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged.     ""The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat,"" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.     ""The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today,"" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute.     ""Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits,"" Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.     Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a ""serious breakdown in the entire inspection system.""     Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by ""intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses.""     Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government's program, calling it ""one of the most respected public health programs in the world.""     FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year.     Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased.     He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem.     Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.     The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.     ""We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)     The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.     But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much.     ""Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers,"" Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said.     Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants ""voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse.""

grain,"South Korea's purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the United States.     During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.     Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.  Reuter "
livestock,"All steers imported into the United States from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the right jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to identify Mexican steers.     The requirement is not expected to affect the number of Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of entry.     Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87 season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.  Reuter "
grain,The U.S. Agriculture Department is seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan collateral or under price support programs.     The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.     The department said it is possible that producers could be encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting the premiums and discounts.     Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is required by law by May 10.  Reuter 
interest,"The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.     As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy.     ""On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,"" Wojnilower said in a report.     ""Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,"" Wojnilower said.     He said last week's ""hiccup"" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.     Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

trade,"Canada plans to monitor steel shipments flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.     ""To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market, the government is taking further action to ensure we have more accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"" Carney said.     Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were considering establishing a joint commission to study the growing steel problem.     Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the monitoring program.     Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.     The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic steel industry.

trade,"Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.     The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.     Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year.         ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.     ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander said in an interview.     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.     The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger.     Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.     In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels.     As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit.     The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.     ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.     Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States.     Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.     Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none.     But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets.     ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.     The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems.     The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.     In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget.     On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.     While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.     ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""     Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.     ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street.""     The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year.     The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.  Reuter "
coffee,"Colombia's coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association said.     ""The philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed,"" he told Reuters.     On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount.     Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years.     He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia.     ""The only change that could happen is, because of the volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations would be for June shipment, etc"" Arango said.  Reuter "
interest,"Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.     In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements.     ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.     Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends.     Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.     ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.     The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems.     The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect.     ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term,"" Koehler said.     A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP.     ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.     If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..     But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S.     When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.     Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates.     It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.     A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.     Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said.     In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.  REUTER "

""We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,"" a spokesman told Reuters.

The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.     Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said.

The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

interest,"Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said.     Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates.     Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however.     Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation.     But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.     It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.     Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.     ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity.""     Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.

dlr,"European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much.     The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.     Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range.     ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.     However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.     Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen.     A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.     London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside.     Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said.     Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend.     Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""     Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.     However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.     Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year.     One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.     The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range.     A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""     But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability.     ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.     A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment.     ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source told Reuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""     Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patent remedy?"" he asked.     Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.     A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.     Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.

trade,"Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

dlr,"European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much.     The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.     Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range.     ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.     However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.     Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen.     A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.     London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside.     Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the long term, the traders said.     Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend.     Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""     Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.     However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.     Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year.     One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.     The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range.     A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""     But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability.     ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.

wheat,"The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.     FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.     World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.     ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.     FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.     FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.  REUTER "

dlr,"The United States, which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies.     Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.     But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.     And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.     Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.     ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday.     The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations.     In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action ""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.     The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability.     The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.     They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings.     West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.     Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place.     No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris.     European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.     A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said.     Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.     Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.     Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.     The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.     Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.     The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances.     Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required.     But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.     The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.     The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years.  Reuter "

gnp,"The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.""     The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion."" REUTER^M "
interest,"The head of Spain's employers' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government's monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment.     He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  REUTER "

grain,"India's national foodgrain target has been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its annual report for 1986/87.     Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country.     The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).     Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.     The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln.    India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990.     Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said.     ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued,"" it said.  Reuter "

interest,"Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.     Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene ""as and when necessary.""     He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.     Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament.     ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk,"" he said.     Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States.""     Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit.     ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year,"" Lawson said.     The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.     Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.""     Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant.""     He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that ""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been ""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing,"" he said.     Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement.     Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand.     They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below yesterday's last 1.8365/75.     Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.     Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7 as ""soft as wax.""     Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no current reason to change monetary course at present.     Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may be under consideration.     German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70 pct after 3.80 yesterday.     Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 3.80 pct.     But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger said, ""since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.""     Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.     Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965 last night.

oilseed,"Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.     The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  Reuter "

livestock,"Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.     The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.     The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.     ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.      Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be identified.     Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.     Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  Reuter "

trade,"Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year.     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.     ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.     Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year.     ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month.     ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in its monthly report.     Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.

The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country.     Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.     ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland's Donegan.     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn.     Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory.""

It estimated the 1985/86 crop at 8.08 mln, vs 8.08 mln last month.

grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.     In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month.     USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising"" because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.     All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said.     Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.     USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.     The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill,"" USDA said.     Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently.     USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.  Reuter "

crude,"The United States' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates.     Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977.     ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.     Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990.     ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,"" Lichtblau said.     He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration.     Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.     ""An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.     Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.     A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.     Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

grain,"U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest buyers.     Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September 1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.     Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the four-week average, it said.     Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.     Other significant purchasers for the current year were Mexico and Honduras, it said.     Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.     Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major purchasers, the department said.     Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell 31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.     Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400 tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700 tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the Department said.     Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200 bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88 season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level but nine pct below the four-week average.     Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.

interest,"Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.     Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.     ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.     Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.     However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings.     ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.     Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.     The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.     Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.     ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.     ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.     He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.     In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan.     The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November.     ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan of Dean Witter.     If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.  Reuter "

interest,"Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate.     They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all.     Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates.     The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure.     The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly.     They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements.     They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other.     The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies.     Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said.     In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said.     Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.     This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies.     At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.  REUTER "

However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.     Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods.     Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

sugar,"A sugar mill which was this nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.     The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said.     ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.     Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.     At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar.     ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.     He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.     Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.     He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy.     ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said.     HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.     It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.     Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. ""We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die,"" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  REUTER "
trade,"Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,"" he said.     He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct.     The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.     Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner.     Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei.     Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.     Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials.     The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.     Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.     ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.  REUTER "

At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed.     ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood.""     Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain.     ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds.""     ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use them.""     He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.     ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets.""     On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.     He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said.     Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners.     Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.

coffee,"Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.     The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added.     Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa.     Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.     The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added.     Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion.     The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.     The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.     CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

grain,"A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials said.     They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month.     Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell.     Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.     About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.     Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible.     In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.      The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued.

MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances.     Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to 47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between 30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.     A major tax reform, including the introduction of a Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in an effort to cure problems in state spending.     But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's deficit under control.     The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said.     The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.  REUTER "
bop,"The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S> said.     Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication.     ""For the past two years, the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable,"" it said.     The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.     ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.     The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past. ""Unfortunately, successful adjustment to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process,"" it said.     In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.     Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988 from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected, ANZ said.  REUTER "

trade,"National Bank economic data for 1986 shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and the value of the dinar fell.     The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.     Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.     Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344 mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.     Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.     Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.     Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages were too high given the level of productivity.     Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.     Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9 billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.

trade,"Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.     Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.     However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.     Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.     The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S.     The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.     In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.     In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.     Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan.     Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London, because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.     However, British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.     By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.     The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.     At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.     EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.     They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.     One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam, they point out.

grain,"Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.     ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.     Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.     However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures.     He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.     If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.     ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,"" Condon said.     ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.     Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.  REUTER "

gnp,"The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.     The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year.     Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.     The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less favourable"" than those of the other three.     The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.     The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year.     The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""     They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""     They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable.""     These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring.     However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar.     Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.     The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.     They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.     All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000.     These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.     The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline.""     The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.     They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.     The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.  REUTER "

gnp,"The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990.     In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year.     But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.""     The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.""     The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.     However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open.     The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.     The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government.     They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax.     The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.     They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies.     The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.     The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.     The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim for more competition, it said.  REUTER "

Bangemann said ""The government, agreeing with the majority, sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority.""

dlr,"Top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they believe they strengthened in talks last week.     Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.     Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar.""     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation, leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.""     But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result.     Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.     Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.     ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not (into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said.     Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the dollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintained artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is not healthy.""     And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession, he said.     Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of life, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.""     But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.     U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.     ""The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements,"" Baker told the meetings.     Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels.     Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism.     West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn.     Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.     The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.     The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given the policy commitments summarized in this statement.""     Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week's statement read.     Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S. Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.  Reuter "

interest,"Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut interest rates.     ""I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"" Bentsen told NBC Television's ""Meet the Press.""     Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take ""billions off the debt service of the Latin countries"" and help ease protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.     Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.     ""You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus, enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation there,"" he said.     Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.     ""I think that more does have to be done there in negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs (newly industrialized countries),"" he said.     Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized countries were underway privately.     Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22 billion dlrs in new revenues.     The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.     Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it would not happen without President Reagan's support.     Darman called for a ""top level negotiation"" between the White House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class entitlement programs, ""a reasonable, steady rate of growth in defense"" and reform of the budget process.

gnp,"Portugal's economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest government crisis, analysts said.     But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.     Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.     The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office.     In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.     Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.     ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,"" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.     ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.     Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress.     The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution.     Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.     Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year.     But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development.     Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament.     Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,"" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said.     He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year.     The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority.     A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.     Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms.     The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  REUTER "
cpi,"Hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.     The official MTI news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.     The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said.     The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.     MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances.  Reuter "

The four Assay Offices also marked 832,222 foreign gold articles, up 2.5 pct on last year.     In weight terms the 7.19 mln grams of British gold assayed was a 15.3 pct increase, while the 2.95 mln grams of foreign gold represented a rise of 3.1 pct.

trade,"Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.     Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.     However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.     The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S.     The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.  Reuter "
trade,"The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.     They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.     The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are ""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.""     Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports.     The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action.     They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.     In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.     Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.  Reuter "

grain,"The U.S. Agriculture Department has lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a senior USDA official said.     USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.     The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.     In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to be identified said.     The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago, Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.     The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon last week and will be effective today, he said.     Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein premium would remain unchanged.

trade,"Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,"" he said.     He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct.     The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.     Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner.     Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei.     Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.     Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials.     The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.     Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.     ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.  REUTER "

The report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from March 30 to April 4.     It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring.     However, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said.     Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said.     Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.  Reuter "

Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet.     The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but ""the idea of protection is implicit,"" one said.

interest,"Major U.S. banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.     In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.     ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.     Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point.     He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.     ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.     ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.     ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.     However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.     Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""     Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.     In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.     Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""     Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.     That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected.     On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements.     ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"" said Jones of Lanston.     ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point.""     Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.     Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar.     Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.     ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately. Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.    Reuter "

In addition, Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an acquisition, he said.

Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6 pct.     Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.     However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems.

Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6 pct.     Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.     However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems.

crude,"OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas said.     In an article headlined, ""Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd,"" it warned OPEC's official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies.     It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.     ""The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the European and American markets,"" the daily said.     The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details.     ""Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew,"" it said.

crude,"Texaco Inc has re-established some key oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.     ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"" Yates told Reuters in an interview.     The company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether. Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.     Manufacturers Hanover Corp MHC> and other banks told Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp CMB> and J.P. Morgan Co's JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits to cover transactions, it said.     The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.     The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.     ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies.     ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""     He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said.     It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co ARC> asked for special safeguards.     The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC BP> last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on supplying. They had cancelled last week.""     He declined to identify the company.     Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.     But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the Algerians, he added.     Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter 11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.     ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer and Traub.     ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""     But other officials at Texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.  Reuter "

Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. ""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,"" he said.    ""The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market,"" he added.     OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.     Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.""     He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.     In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.  Reuter "

""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added.      Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing.     However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry,"" one New York trader said.

Another trader, however, described today's activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in bankruptcy.     Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins for Texaco's trades.     New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information.

crude,"Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.     CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia.     Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao.     It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.     To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.     The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.  Reuter "

bop,"South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.     Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports.     He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow.     ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,"" he added.     Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986.     ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said.     The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.     South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.     The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.     ""The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,"" Koo said.     Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. ""It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,"" he said.     He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added ""We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.""

trade,"China's trade deficit in the first quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same 1986 period, customs figures show.     Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau, quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28 billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.     He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only 350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.     Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.

trade,"Basic reform of Japan's protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said.     The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said.     ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.     The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said.     Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.     Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added.     ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""     Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.     Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said.     ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University.     Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations told a recent press conference.     External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan.     But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.     Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.     The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said.     Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said.     Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.     Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.  REUTER "
cpi,"Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.     The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986.     Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year.      Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's 1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier, it said.     Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in February, in line with previous months, although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.     Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.

trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected.      But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets.     ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.     U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month, they said.     ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.     Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.     A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.     Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.     He cited the example of a California company which transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal, he said.     U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.     Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry.     The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And Japanese officials have said.    Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries, but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.    Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies, including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.  REUTER "
trade,"Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.     The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior LDP officials said at a press conference.     LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.     Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.     Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated. However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.     The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers, LDP officials said.     According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.     The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.     The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week, they said.     The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May.  REUTER "

trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world's largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.     Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join.

trade,"President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade.     The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.     Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film.     The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.     In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""     He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.     U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.""     Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.     About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.     Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.     He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.     Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation.     The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up.     U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.     Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).     It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.     U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States.  Reuter "
interest,"White House Budget chief James Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might ""overreact"" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession next year.     ""Our greatest danger is overreaction,"" Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday. ""I'm concerned about the Fed's overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply.""     Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published in the New York Times today, were accurate.     Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have ""political consequences.""     The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year.     ""My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup, and there is no question about it,"" he said.     Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.     Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar.     Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects.     U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States.

trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.     Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""     Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.     Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.     He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance.     Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.""     Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers.     He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.     ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well,"" Yeutter said.     He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.""     Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.     He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit.""  reuter "
trade,"The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.     The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports.     Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.     A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward.     The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.     ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.     ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.""     The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.     The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979.     Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis.     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.     Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.     ""We're considering it,"" he said, ""It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think it's time has come.""

trade,"The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.     But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern.""     He said it left the United States open to retaliation.     The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed.     In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal"" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.     Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said.     Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.     The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.     The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit.     But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all.     Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets.     ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara.     He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement.     U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.     The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice.""     The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.""     But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.     ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.""     Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.""     He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""     But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.     Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back.

trade,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market liberalisation efforts falter or fail.     In a press conference after talks with South Korean leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention to regulate exports and boost imports ""a very, very important step, the right direction for the Korean government to take.""     The government adopted the new policies last week in the hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.     Baldrige said the policies ""showed an understanding of the fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by exports alone.""     ""There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth begins to take more of the load,"" he said.     South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.     Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was ""broad enough and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if the government is willing to follow through.""     ""We will be watching the implementation of this new policy direction very closely,"" he said. ""Because of the protectionism growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see protectionist movement in the U.S.""     Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific product categories.     These included service industries, which he said were still too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them sell for up to three times their American prices.     ""We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's going to be trouble somewhere down the road,"" he said. ""We are just pointing this out.""     Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for months, Baldrige declined to comment. ""We don't have any target for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various economies involved,"" he said.     Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in third countries. The American government would be pleased to encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.     Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to its difficulties with South Korea.     ""I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"" he said. ""It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for nothing or just by asking for it.     ""But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they usually end up with something good happening at the end that both countries live up to.""  REUTER "

crude,"Asian countries are offering better oil exploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to last year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.     The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price fall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, which found it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.     Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8 billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated to have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled in Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.     The report said Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co Ltd>, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30 pct cut in exploration and production spending last year.     To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reduced petroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.     Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct to cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its 12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional exporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran. Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in 1986 from 40 billion the previous year.     Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986 from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.     Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion, China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.     However, Asian importers saved between eight and nine billion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably eased their balance of payments.     South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan were major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistan respectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year.  REUTER "
grain,"Japan's policy of self-sufficiency in rice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting U.S. Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference.     He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan had a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But with other countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product.     Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture minister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.     Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.     ""We want to have some access in the rice market,"" he said.     He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He told reporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan on rice.     Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency.     Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue, Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Rice industry would do.     Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or August this year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by the U.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in the meantime.

trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Japanese government officials do not seem to understand that protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to an explosive situation and protectionist legislation.     Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng said protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly during the last six months.     ""It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive. We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory laws which would have very serious consequences for other countries, especially Japan,"" Lyng told reporters.     Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision, requiring retaliation against countries which have trade surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.     U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a Washington Democrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that the Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade legislation is taken up later this month.     Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the volatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress is increasingly unpredictable, he said.     ""The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I cannot emphasise that enough,"" Lyng said.     In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato yesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import quotas on beef and citrus.     Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S. Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been introduced in both the House and Senate.     Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products since 1964, especially grains.     He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land area, is concerned about maintaining some level of self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.     But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.     Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of farm products as it did in 1973.

trade,"The World Bank has suggested India should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external trade policy with reduced levels of protection.     A confidential ""executive summary"" of a draft Bank report on the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of Indian goods by making them more competitive.     The summary said, ""These reforms would result in (domestic) prices much more in line with world prices than is true today, and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen.""     The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports.     ""The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers,"" the summary said.     An Indian official told Reuters the government was discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give further details.     The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.     The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87, which ended in March.     It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by national savings, mainly from the private sector.     India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.     But the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of India's import bill.     India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the summary said.     The Bank's summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position.     It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87, Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.     Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments, the summary said.     It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued. India ""might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs,"" it said.     ""An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"" the summary said.     It said such an approach had been successful in countries such as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce import pressures.     Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost exports.  REUTER "

trade,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market liberalisation efforts falter or fail.     In a press conference after talks with South Korean leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention to regulate exports and boost imports ""a very, very important step, the right direction for the Korean government to take.""     The government adopted the new policies last week in the hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.     Baldrige said the policies ""showed an understanding of the fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by exports alone.""     ""There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth begins to take more of the load,"" he said.     South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.     Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was ""broad enough and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if the government is willing to follow through.""     ""We will be watching the implementation of this new policy direction very closely,"" he said. ""Because of the protectionism growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see protectionist movement in the U.S.""     Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific product categories.     These included service industries, which he said were still too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them sell for up to three times their American prices.     ""We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's going to be trouble somewhere down the road,"" he said. ""We are just pointing this out.""     Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for months, Baldrige declined to comment. ""We don't have any target for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various economies involved,"" he said.     Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in third countries. The American government would be pleased to encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.     Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to its difficulties with South Korea.     ""I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"" he said. ""It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for nothing or just by asking for it.     ""But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they usually end up with something good happening at the end that both countries live up to.""  REUTER "

Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30 pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.     Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets, remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide protection for intellectual property rights.     He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable currency relationships.     Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses and falling commodity prices in recent years, is over subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend of growing farm subsidies.     ""This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to find solutions,"" Howe said.

John Ni, director of the Ministry's Industrial Development and Investment Centre (IDIC), said under the IDIC proposal, Taiwanese firms would be encouraged to set up factories and invest in property and securities markets in the U.S..     Taiwan's 1986 investment in the U.S. Totalled 46 mln U.S. Dlrs, official statistics show.     The investment was mainly in the electronics, food, service and trading sectors.     The new proposal, approved by Economic Minister Lee Ta-hai yesterday, calls for investment of 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in 1987, 120 mln in 1988, 160 mln in 1989, 240 mln in 1990 and 400 mln in 1991, he told Reuters.     It will be discussed soon by officials of the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank and the Council for Economic Planning and Development before being submitted to the cabinet for final approval, he said.     ""This is the first ambitious proposal with government initiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,"" Lee said.     He said government incentives to prospective Taiwanese investors would include bank loans and a five-year income tax holiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also be simplified.     A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investment would be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americans and avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwanese products.     The plan will also help reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said.     The rising surplus has enabled Taiwan to accumulate some 54 billion U.S. Dlrs in foreign exchange reserves.     Economists described the proposal as a significant step by the government to head off U.S. Protectionism.     ""Time is running out for us.

GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey.      The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey.     Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.

But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.     More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said.     The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports.     He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.  REUTER "

Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.

crude,"Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000, probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.     ""I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000). Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,"" Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee.     Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.     Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.  Reuter "
crude,"The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.     Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said.     They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations.     Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.     Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said.     This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added.     Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.  REUTER "
interest,"The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said.     The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said.     The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.     But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves.     Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark.     Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.     Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.     ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.     Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany.     A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.     The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. ""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.     A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.     The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.     But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""     Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.     But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.     ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"" said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.     Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But I don't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.     Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions.     Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.     Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.     But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however.     Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.     On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.     Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century.     But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.

gnp,"The West German government's independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said.     A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable.     It added the council believed ""an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.""     Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase.     The government regularly uses the term ""changed external economic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level.     Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.     The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week's seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.     West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.     The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.     The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.     Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  REUTER "
trade,"The White House has completed a new review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.     They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.     But there was no hint what the announcement might be.     Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.     But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.     The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods.     The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.     Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact.  reuter "

gas,"U.S. analysts expect the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended May 29, oil traders and analysts said.     While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.     Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil prices, the analysts said.     Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports continue at relatively high levels.     Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.     Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who looks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasoline demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added.     Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.         The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.     But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3 pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.     Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add to U.S. stocks.     But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery runs.     Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between 700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was discounted as having a market impact at this time.     ""A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"" one futures analyst said.     Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels reported by API for the week of may 22.     The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added to the nation's inventory.  Reuter "
trade,"U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the U.S. Had expected.     But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.     Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand.      ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.     ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.     ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,"" he added.     But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:     ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market.     ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.""     He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data.     The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value.     Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.     Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem.     He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.

""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"" one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.     Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures.     Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light, with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell, dealers said.     Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest.     Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.     Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month, they added.  Reuter "

crude,"The operator of a major U.S. crude oil pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be several days before repairs are made and the system is functioning again.     Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco Inc TX>, operator of the pipeline through its subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs will begin in about five days and expects it to take several more days to complete.     ""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get the job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to assess because of flooding on the Red River.     The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.     The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.     Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with customers to determine their requirements.     Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the  shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.

Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest improvement in tanker rates.     Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.         He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.     For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year ago.

In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been delaying deliveries.     As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.

trade,"With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today.     The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago.     ""While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.     The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation.     CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms.     Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries.     President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year.     However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation.     Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said.     He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.     Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.     ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

The rains replenished formerly low soil moisture reserves, with reserves in all areas now rated good, the report said.     Plantings were virtually complete across the province and germination was well advanced. However, some fields still showed spotty stands.     Cereal crops in the southwest were 90 pct germinated, with some fields already in the subsequent tillering stage, it said. Oilseeds in the northwest region were about 80 pct emerged in many areas, with other regions 50 to 70 pct emerged.  Reuter "

ship,"The U.S. House of Representatives  approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions.     The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.     The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships.     The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.     It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.     The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.     Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy.     But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report.  Reuter "

""The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this arrangement,"" Warner said.     Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively deployed within 24 hours of a decision.     Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations multinational force, or failing that, an American, British, French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.

crude,"A Colombian group announced the suspension of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY>.     There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN).     According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.     The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.     In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.     Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.     If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the penalty.  Reuter "

""But I do not want to be alarmist,"" he told a news conference after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.     He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last year. ""There are also other potential sources of supplies in the world,"" he added.     The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the ministers' meeting, he added.     A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual meeting on June 19, he said.     But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC foreign ministers, diplomats said.     West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil supplies.

In a recent interview with the French communist party newspaper l'humanite, Cuban president Fidel Castro said that crude sugar production during the harvest would be ""less than 7.5 mln tonnes.     The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain which reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonable rain storms during the first two months of this year which made cane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.

Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debate this week on a major trade bill.     ""It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners running a surplus with the United States should be beaten over the head if trade barriers objected to by the United States are not removed within a certain time-scale,"" said Denman in an apparent reference to some of the measures in the congressional trade bill.     ""If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliation and counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading system will very quickly unravel,"" he said.     Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was not purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.     ""The trade deficit results from a combination of macroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchange rate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"" Denman said.     He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfair trade prctices.     He said the European Community had recently updated a list of some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.

Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could see some further decline in the dollar within reason.     ""All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in the dollar would be counterproductive,"" Baker told reporters.     Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that the United States wants a stable dollar.     The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit, but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar against the yen and the mark during the past two years.

grain,"The U.S. corn and soybean crops are in mostly good condition and have not suffered any yield deterioration from recent hot, dry weather, Agriculture Department and private weather and crop analysts said.     ""I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet,"" Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. ""The (corn and soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and is progressing ahead of normal, which is good,"" he said.     Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areas sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing new crop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrs per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.     ""This rally is amazing,"" a private crop analyst said. ""Corn, soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition.""     The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm, dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up development of the crop, which will help the crop better cope with stress later in its more critical growing period.     ""What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards rapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on the subsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go through a little stress early on,"" Strommen said.     Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in most growing areas.     Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July and August.     But because of its early development this year, Strommen said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction period by the first of July.     ""Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or soybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks,"" an analyst said.     Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop analysts agreed.     August and September are the critical yield-producing months for soybeans, Strommen said.     ""The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive during May, June and July until the August rains which determine the crop,"" a crop analyst said.     Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure that there will not be problems later.     Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in much of the corn belt.     ""This opens up all sorts of speculation,"" he said.  Reuter "
grain,"Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with more forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today on the Chicago Board of Trade.     Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the 30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for delivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a bushel.     ""The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than normal for some time out,"" said David Bartholomew, assistant vice president for Merrill Lynch. ""We have probably gone as high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to measure the euphoria level.""     Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week, posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.     Corn futures set contract highs in March through September, with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4 dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved harvest conditions in the southern Midwest.     The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit young plants by encouraging the development of deep root systems, Bartholomew said.     European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean orders went unfilled at the close, traders said.     After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.     Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more expensive for foreign buyers.     But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle steady.     Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures, which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S. trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.     A USDA report released after trading said the number of cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.     USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52 mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade forecasts.     A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May, up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off 93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.     Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot weather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.  Reuter "

gold,"The glitter of gold has generated a three-way competition among the world's largest futures exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.     When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe as the world's precious metals futures capital for institutional business.     And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds) gold futures.     The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in 1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument in July 1986.     CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the decision may also have been clearing problems in May which forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades, especially in silver futures.     Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals contracts, industry sources say.     But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.     While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions, was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.     ""The climate could not be better for this venture by the CME,"" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil McGarrity.     ""Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears. There's good trading volume in all world outlets,"" McGarrity added.     ""The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers, merchants and customers that there would be a market open for trading,"" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. and a Comex board member.     Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies delivery from New York and Chicago vaults.     The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start allows for trading before many important government reports are released at 7:30 a.m. CDT.     CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge their financial risks.     ""If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy gold,"" said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.     The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold trading. ""Given our night trading session, we could add either our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver contract to attract overseas business,"" a CBT official said.     Which market is identified as the precious metal capital does not appear to be a major issue among professionals.     ""We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with perhaps different needs,"" Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry Jarecki said.     ""Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid contract. Our firm is no exception,"" Jarecki said.     ""At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing processes,"" a CME official added.  Reuter "

dlr,"The dollar should worth more than 170 yen based on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on international trade.     Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth quarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.     MITI also said the so-called ""J-curve"" and the drop in oil prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6 billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.     On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.     The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5 billion dlrs and the ""J-curve"" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in the 1986 surplus.     Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in recent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in economic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36 pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.     Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982 to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic growth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other minor factors have been left out.     ""One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of exports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to experience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally predisposed to growth in exports,"" MITI said.     Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under the impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.     Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor in the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe, replacing design and brand reputations.     ""The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for measures to address the needs of affected firms,"" it said. ""Whole industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to suffer.""     ""Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will also be an essential condition,"" the ministry said.     It said four structural factors have contributed to the growth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline in U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies and short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.     ""While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with the dollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in the import picture,"" MITI said.  REUTER "

bop,"Treasurer Paul Keating said he now expected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs.     In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figures showed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs, Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about 1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billion issued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.     However, the government had subsequently revised the forecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of current account figures indicated a declining trend.     Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecast compares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in 1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficit recorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.     Keating said the main reason for his revision was a better-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterly figures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year to March 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.     The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficit for the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billion dlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier.  REUTER "

oilseed,"Uruguayan suppliers have agreed to supply Taiwan with only 25,000 tonnes of soybeans out of a total 70,000 tonnes agreed in April, a spokesman for the joint committee of Taiwan's soybean importers told Reuters.     He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayans reluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56 U.S. Dlrs per tonne.     The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment after the Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order, but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June 5-25, the committee spokesman said.     Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayan grain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices on the soybeans but said the government would not intervene in the dispute.     ""The deal was agreed to between two private companies, without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayan government,"" Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman Andres Bonino said.     He added, ""Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes of soybeans, since total production this year has been lower than that figure.""     The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the 70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.     Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, told reporters, ""Both countries are finishing details to arrive at a satisfactory price.""     He said the price would be ""very advantageous (for Uruguay) because it will be above the international price.""     Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year, making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed.

He said the increase was to meet rising local consumption, estimated at about 500,000 tonnes in calendar 1988 against 470,000 tonnes in 1987. Taiwan would have a surplus for export of about 100,000 tonnes in 1988, he said.     In 1987 Taiwan would have no exportable sugar for the first time in 40 years because of typhoon damage to more than 6,000 hectares of canefield in 1986, he said.  REUTER "

Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June and July to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenance work at oil mills.     But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightly above monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for a while due to a better crushing margin compared with that of soybeans, they said.

gnp,"Japan's gross national product (gnp) rose a real 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardly revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months, the Economic Planning Agency said.     The October/December rise was originally put at 0.8 pct.     For the fiscal year ended last March 31, gnp rose 2.6 pct, after a 4.3 pct increase in 1985/86. Last year's performance was the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct, and was below the government's revised three pct forecast.     Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for the slowdown in economic growth in 1986/87.     Domestic demand increased 0.7 pct in the January/March quarter and 4.3 pct in the fiscal year, compared with growth of 0.6 pct in October/December and 3.7 pct in 1985/86.     The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarter accelerated to 4.9 pct, from 2.9 pct in October/December.     In nominal terms, gnp rose 0.7 pct in January/March, after a 0.5 pct October/December rise, reflecting lower prices.     Domestic demand contributed 0.7 percentage point to real gnp growth in January/March, while foreign trade added 0.5 point. In October/December domestic demand contributed 0.6 point, while foreign trade added 0.2 point.     Of the 0.5 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp last quarter, rising exports accounted for 0.3 point and falling imports contributed 0.2.     Total export volume rose 2.0 pct quarter-on-quarter in January/March, while imports fell 1.2 pct.     Of the 0.7 point contribution of domestic demand to January/March gnp growth, the private sector accounted for 1.1 point while the public sector knocked off 0.4.     The private sector contribution included 0.4 point for corporate capital outlays and 1.0 for consumer spending, while destocking subtracted 0.3 point.     In 1986/87, domestic demand contributed 4.1 percentage points to growth while foreign trade knocked off 1.5 points.

crude,"OPEC has regained its former role as price-setter in the oil market following last year's price war, acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.     But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand for OPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continued sacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.     Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, said the December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr per barrel reference price gave the market a signal that the producers' group was serious.     ""It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and this has restored its credibility,"" said al-Chalabi, who is in Caracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.     Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded the production quotas which took effect on February 1 and spot market prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.     Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basic dilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said. ""The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price and risk losing its market share? Or defend its market share and let the price drop?"" he asked.     ""OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question is how long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?""  he said.     Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up prices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw no quick end to restraint in production.     He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil because increased non-OPEC production, combined with conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, has caused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

gnp,"Government officials said the worst may be over for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger than expected growth in the January/March period.     But private economists were not so sure and said the economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.     As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.     The government economists acknowledged that the improved export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two pct from the previous three months.     The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150 probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June quarter, they said.     However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.     Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy will achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the 1987/88 year.     Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last December from an original four pct.     Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.     Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in nominal income stays low, he added.      The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the preceding three months, Takahashi said.     Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but this was primarily because utility companies brought forward their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation package announced last fall, he said.     Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.     Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.     Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the sector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000 billion yen economic package will also help the economy.     But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth might come close to three pct.  REUTER "
sugar,"Indonesia will try to increase sugar output in calendar 1988 to 2.4 mln tonnes from an expected 2.2 mln in 1987, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said.     He told reporters after meeting President Suharto the gains will come from increasing average production to 10 tonnes per hectare from the previous 6.2 tonnes.     He said Indonesia is aiming to pass the United States to become the world's fourth largest producer compared with its current seventh position.     Affandi said the increase would insure Indonesia's self-sufficiency in the commodity and allow it to keep adequate stocks.     Indonesia said it produced 2.02 mln tonnes in 1986, but the U.S. Embassy in its annual agriculture report said output was 1.8 mln tonnes. The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987.     Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last year and in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks.     The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar cane farms.

grain,"Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm markets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of farm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato said.     He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.     But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.     Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S. Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports except in emergency.     Kato said Japanese farmers should however ""shed some blood,"" to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.     His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice Price Council at which the government advisory body will discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.     Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May.     Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need to cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.     Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect producers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export enhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends only 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the world's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per farm family was several times lower than in the United States.     Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in U.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a factor increasing protectionism in the United States.     Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's import restrictions on 12 farm items.

trade,"Toshiba Corp TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels, despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen told Reuters.

The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.     Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.     Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.     Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year's level of 12,000 to 16,000 units a year.     Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.  REUTER "
interest,"The Belgian National Bank said it cut one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by 0.10 points, effective immediately.     The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the central bank said in a telex.     A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct discount rate.     The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main monetary policy instrument for the last two years.     The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.     The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on June 5, also by 0.10 points.  REUTER "

sugar,"Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.     Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year.     The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes.     For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.     Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23.     Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.     The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.     Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.     However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said.     Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.""     Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request.     Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.""     In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas.     He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest.     Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  REUTER "

coffee,"European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.     Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.     ""The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, "" one said.     However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas.     Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries.     The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials.     Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.     Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.     ""Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,"" one trader said.     ""We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"" one official said.     ""We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,"" he added.     Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.     ""Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, "" he said.     ""The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,"" one trader said.     ""However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,"" the official said.

grain,"Indonesia rejected World Bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5 billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.     Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""     The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.     The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money.     Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.     Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.     The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity.     However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.     He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention in the developed nations.""

grain,"U.S. House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.     The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.     The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.     The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides told Reuters.     Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings.     Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.     House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.     But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims.     Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn.     However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.     Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity.     Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.     Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said.     Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.     This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.  Reuter "
crude,"Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.     They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive.     There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.     But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.     ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""     Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales.     Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a ""package.""     Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers.     OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.     Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say.     The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.     Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.     Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices.    Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.     In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen.     Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.     But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna.     ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.  REUTER "

interest,"Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.     A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates.     News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said.     ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.     Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates.     It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's strength.     The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said.     The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention.     ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.     ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed,"" Skeoch said.     ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added.     ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.     But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention.     He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.     However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal higher inflation this year.     ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As long as that continues we're okay,"" he added.  REUTER "

crude,"The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible, the Press Association reported.     The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig.     An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable.     It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said.     Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole.     The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.

trade,"The European Community (EC) accused the United States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee.     EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.     Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to improve its balance of payments.     The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue.     Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers, pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.     When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as ""standstill and rollback.""     Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security.     Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.     The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges.     The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.     The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation.     Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community, brought the dispute to the GATT last year.  Reuter "

Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S. Legislators were failing to realise ""the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.     A British parliamentary report said that up to March British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.     The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and ""selectiveness"" towards foreign contractors had denied British competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them from technological research for SDI.     Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts under conditions of fair and open competition. ""All we ask is for our companies to be given similar opportunities,"" he added.     If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures, Younger said.

gnp,"A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report.     Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.     As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.     ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.     Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.     The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before.     The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.     This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.     As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.     The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.     ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.     Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" he added.

grain,"Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S. farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal.     The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.     Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs.     Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his ""Family Farm Act.""     -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture.     -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports.     This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices.     Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable.     -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices.     Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J. Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct Quaker Oats.     -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.     He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years.     Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.     -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income.  Reuter "
gnp,"West German economic growth will slow to 1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy.     This view is less favourable than the West German government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.     The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year, with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms.     The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future.     But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.     While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.""     Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986.     Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.     West Germany's current account surplus, the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988.

gnp,"France's growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year.     The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987.      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.     The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.     The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.  REUTER "
gnp,"Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.     The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987, but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.     The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said.     This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.     Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.  REUTER "
trade,"Japan's trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct.     But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988, ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""     It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.     The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.     The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth.     The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.  Reuter "
trade,"U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact, according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups.     The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries.     But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement.""     The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries.     The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained.     Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices.     He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.     Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada.     A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.     It would also increase the gross national products of both countries.     Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.     While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said.     In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast to decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.     Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices.     Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year. REUTER "
gnp,"Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness.     In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  REUTER "
gnp,"High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.     The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland.     Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said.     After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway.     Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.  REUTER "
gnp,"The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""     It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.     ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,"" it said.     While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.     The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.     In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.     Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.     ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.     The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.     In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year.     Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988.  Reuter "

Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.     The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's 2.5 pct growth rate.     ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the OECD's economics and statistics department, said.     The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.     ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets.     But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""     This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.     The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.     Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact.     He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.     The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986.     There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year.     The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers.

gnp,"Australia's economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.     The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year, however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.     The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.     The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year, should again show growth over the next two years, rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.  Reuter "
gnp,"Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.     ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.     Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget.     And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.     Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues.     But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system.     The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991.     Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct.     Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  Reuter "

Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.     CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.

gnp,"South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government's target of three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.     The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.     It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year.     It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.     The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.     South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986.

Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer, starting with Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.     Showa Shell Sekiyu KK SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.     Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.     ""We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption,"" Showa Shell said.     Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.     High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total gasoline sales in Japan, it added.     Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.     Nippon Oil Co Ltd NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales.     The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years.     ""Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas,"" an official at a major oil company said.     An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness.     Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil, Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.     Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct from the previous year, according to a MITI report.  REUTER "

crude,"Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.     Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.     Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards.     Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.     Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency.     The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.      Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said.     The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year.      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said.

""We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review,"" Lukman said.     The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable.     ""I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far,"" Lukman said.     He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.

interest,"More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates.     And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money.     The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business.     While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago.     But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts.     As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds.     ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages.     The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more.     Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said.     The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans.     ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans.     But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product.""     Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.     The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.     ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume.     In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets.     But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money.     Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.     Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument.     But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably.     However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor.     For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years.  REUTER "

sugar,"Cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.     Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields.     But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth.     Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development, Licht said.     In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal.     In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.     In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible.     In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, Licht said.     In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.     In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.     In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development.     Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year.  Reuter "

trade,"Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996.     A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year.     In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.     The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.     PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue.     The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.  Reuter "

crude,"U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session.     They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986.     OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review.     Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.     Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices should begin easing.     ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.     OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter.     This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.     Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output.     ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.     But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.     ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild.     However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions.     Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.     Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil.     ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.     ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he said.     One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.     ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites.     Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts.     ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.  Reuter "
crude,"Unocal Corp said it told the U.S. Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado due to high costs.     Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.     Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs, compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.     The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.     Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project uneconomical even with government price supports and loan guarantees, Unocal said.     The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.  Reuter "

coffee,"European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.     Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.     The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said.     If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said.     Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil.     Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.     ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said.     ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.""     Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.     Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.     ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, "" van Horick said.     At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.     ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,"" van Horick added.  Reuter "

trade,"A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.     Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills.""     He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""     Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.     Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States.     Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.     The European Community has also opposed the bills.     Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.     He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week.     Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation.""     Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress.""     President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation.     Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez said as yet ""the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.""  reuter "
coffee,"A U.S. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.     Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.     ""There is one country which evidently still does not,"" Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.     Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.     He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials.     While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a ""positive letter,"" Rosenbaum said.     The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan.     Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders.     Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.     The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless ""objective criteria"" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.  Reuter "

ship,"The United States said Kuwait was discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of its own vessels under American flags.     State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.     The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.     ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley said. She emphasized, however, that ""if some charter arrangement could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis.""     In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy escort in the Gulf, she said.     The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter.     Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered vessels flying the U.S. flag ""would be protected,"" the newspaper reported.

trade,"The Administration asked Congress to replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.     Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties.     Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face.""     He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.     Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.     He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system, with about half expected to join the system by January 1988.  reuter "
trade,"Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press, said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities.     Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's 2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases.    ""The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags) rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,"" Sarcinelli said in a statement.     Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows.""     ""In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders,"" said the newspaper.     But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.  Reuter "
gnp,"The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.     Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.     ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.     The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.     Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent.     ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, told Reuters.     Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages.     To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says.     ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"" Gramley said.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia.     Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative.     Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession.     Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists.     He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.     ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,"" Mauro said.     In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve.     ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.     But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation.     Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.     The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.     ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit.     A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker.     Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation.     The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. ""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.  Reuter "

He said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today.     He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the guarantee minimum price.  Reuter "
interest,"The six basis point rise of the past month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the dollar holds firm.     ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month, largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities, said.     Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the longer term.     Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.     The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down 1.5 pct, respectively.     Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"" Kahan said.     Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road, he said.     Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently, analysts said.     September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May 18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June, Duggan said.     While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far, and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level.     ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said.     The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S. currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.     ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar,"" Kahan said.     Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.     In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement. However, a successful auction could prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market psychology.  Reuter "

August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.     Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.     They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.     They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October.     Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.     ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""     A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages.""     Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level, after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish factor to be considered.     Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.     Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest.     Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies, dealers said.  REUTER "
crude,"OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.     ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner said.     The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.     Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said.     They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.     ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.     Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.     ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said one international oil trader in Tokyo.     ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.     One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.     Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices.     Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.     Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.     Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast.     Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.  REUTER "
crude,"The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.     They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.     Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December.     The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently.     The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market.     The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.     Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December.     Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said.     The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port.  REUTER "

Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support OPEC's moves to boost oil prices.

crude,"Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle told Reuters.     ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"" he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution.""     The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.     OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.     OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter.     Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices.     Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.     The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.     Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks.     Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable.     Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.     Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986.     But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit.      Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.  REUTER "

""Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of the fact that we have not changed our policy stance,"" a senior central bank official told Reuters.     The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today, the officials said.     The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices, the officials said.     But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid was 3.75 pct, they said.     The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.     The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.     ""We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further,"" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain.

trade,"Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the government relaxed restrictions on some imports including luxury cars.     The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs, compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and 1.113 billion dlrs of imports.     Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery and raw materials, to increase industrial production.     The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told reporters.     Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the government were not included in the policy, they added.     They said the country's total import bill (both commercial and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.     The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the economy.     Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export earnings"" in the coming year.     Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln in 1986/87, according official figures.     But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.  REUTER "

The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.

Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.     Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.

crude,"OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.     Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target.     Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""     Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices.     Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September.     Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half.     Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.     Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.     Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting.      Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes.""     Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said ""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister.""

trade,"The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad.     The move is designed by the government to improve India's trade deficit.     Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.     The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.     RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings.     These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.     RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.     Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

ship,"U.S. moves to increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.     They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.     ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.     Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.     The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers, will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.     Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was ""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""     The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.     The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.     Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.     Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.     The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.     A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.     ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving world opinion against Iran, remarked one.     Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.     Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event of any U.S. strike against Iran.     Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.     Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.     Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.  Reuter "

grain,"Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week, according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather Inc.     ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week.""     Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.     Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.     Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.     ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,"" Mohler said.     Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.     Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage in early July, he said.  Reuter "

interest,"The Treasury Department said it notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948 income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.     The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury said in a two-sentence announcement.     The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands over the past eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman said.     The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the spokesman said.     Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles  may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the spokesman said.     He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance at lower interest rates.     However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced with lower yields.  Reuter "

crude,"A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron Corp's CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels, industry analysts said.     Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch surface choke.     ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co told Reuters.     He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct.     Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled.     ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.     Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well.     ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.     However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures.     Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced.     ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today,"" Osborne said.

Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.

crude,"Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference.     Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to 320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.     ""We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months,"" he said.     Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year.     Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.     ""They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,"" he said.     Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.     While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products, Santos said.  Reuter "
interest,"Sales of new single-family homes tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher mortgage interest rates, analysts said.     ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.     The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce Department said.     Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April, according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.     The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out of the market, he and others said.     ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly unexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted to hold back and see what would happen.""     The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was sharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expected a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" said James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.     Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new homes.     Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.     Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said, ""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.""     Others were less optimistic, however.     ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family housing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.     Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will be maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates. There won't be much specific improvement in coming months.""  Reuter "
ship,"The United States responded to an apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would play purely a deterrent role.     ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.     He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.     Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday, ""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us.     ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S. Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""     The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.     The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.     Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not helpful or welcome.""

trade,"Israel's exports to the U.S. can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.     Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.     ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,"" Yaacobi said.     While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports.     In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.     Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.      He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth.     Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.     Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential.     Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.     Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

trade,"Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products.         Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s.     But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders.     The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said.         Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year.     It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period.     He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms.         Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.     He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls.     ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports.""         He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions.     Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.  Reuter "

The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February. However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials said.     ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.     Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.         There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.     ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.     Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""

He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf.     But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust, can take care of the situation.""     ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation,"" he declared.     Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices, he added.     Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel.     ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater than the downward ones.""     ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand.""     Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.     In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he said.  REUTER "

interest,"Rises in West German and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said.     ""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"" Poehl told an investment conference.     ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates,"" he said.     Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.     Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September.     The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.     These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.     Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.     Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.     But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.     Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and currency developments.     Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.""  The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he said.     Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany, saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.     The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.     ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.     This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market, he said.     Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.     ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures.     The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention, he said.  REUTER "
interest,"Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said.     A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.     Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.      Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.     But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.     Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase.     A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to support the stock and security markets,"" he said.     But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week.     Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.     With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said.     ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big,"" said another.     Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.     Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said.     In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.  REUTER "

crude,"The Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company spokesman said.     The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1 offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.     ""Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300 metres within the Baong formation,"" he said.     He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at 20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.     ""The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln standard cubic feet a day,"" he added.     GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.     ""Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as operator through a joint operating body established by the two companies,"" the Pertamina spokesman stated.     The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1 exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.  REUTER "
crude,"Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return.     President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.     ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto said.     ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry,"" he said.     Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration.     ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.     ""The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis.""     Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say.     Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions.     But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered.     President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated.     Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986.     Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies.     Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.     He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive.     Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""     Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.     Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.     Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested.  REUTER "
crude,"Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.     The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.     The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack, he said.     Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.     He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs ""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed, Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests around the world might come under attack.     Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack significantly affecting oil prices.     IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf.

coffee,"A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources.     ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one analyst said.     On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.     Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry.     While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said.     ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a U.S. Customs spokesman said.     ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),"" he said.     Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system.     ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.      ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers' hands.""     Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled.     According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans.     ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko.     Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term.     ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a threat,"" one trader said.

grain,"The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told Reuters.     In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.     ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).""     When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""     The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit.     ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,"" Lyng said.     ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.     Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.     The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement.     ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union, but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""     When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement.""  Reuter "

interest,"An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state, economists said.     An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.     ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.     After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities.     Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout.     U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.     Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.     ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"" said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.     But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.     It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.     Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.     Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said.     In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales,"" Temperton said.     ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.     ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.     A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending.     Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing.     Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.  REUTER "
crude,"Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.     Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project.     Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.     Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.     Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.     The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.     Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.     BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.     Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said.     September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.     Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.     Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August.     Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August.     Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days.  REUTER "

U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.

trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal.     ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.     Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.     Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.     The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.     However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic.     Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.""     ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.""     Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations  started.     ""All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.     The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said.

coffee,"The Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.     He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.     Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion.     The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.     He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form.     Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday.     A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added.     A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.  Reuter "

trade,"Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.     The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the U.S.     ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng told Reuters in an interview.     He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31, next year.     The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some cheeses and specialty fruit juices.     U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.     The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers.

oilseed,"The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation.     ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.""     ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,"" he said.     The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory.     The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then.     The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax.     The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams said.     The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.     U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.     Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.  Reuter "
trade,"The United States is prepared to ""pull out all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said.     Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.     He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.     The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC.     The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.     Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies, an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected,"" Samuels said.     Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary"" and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic.     The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week.     The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies.     The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions, Samuels said.     Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then.     ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"" the U.S. Ambassador said.     The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.     The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.     If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze, there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation, he added.     Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is a global agreement to end such subsidies.     In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.     ""Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit,"" he said. ""There's no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow, the longer it is to wean it.""     In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.     Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies ""just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy"" and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP.     ""I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those, particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to some agreement to put an end to it,"" he said.

crude,"The Soviet oil production target for 1988 has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over this year's planned output.     Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.     He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983.     Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.     January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.     Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.     The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.  REUTER "
trade,"The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said.     Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products.     But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said.     The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.     Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.     Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.     The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership.     Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada.     Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation.     Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough.""

crude,"U.S. military planners ruled out Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.     U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.     Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf.     ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said.     He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.     In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.     Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire.     ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf.     ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,"" Cordesman said.     He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases.

trade,"The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said.     President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.     The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers.     Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs.     Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.     The Administration officials said Commerce Department  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors.

crude,"The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region.     Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.     The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S. resolve that Iran ""cannot take military action against the United States with impunity.""     Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.     While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S. retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act.

trade,"Canada will propose at the new round of international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.     ""Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a vicious circle which continues to cause problems of overproduction and low commodity prices,"" Carney told the House of Commons.     Carney was outlining the government's new position on the farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     While few details were released, Carney said the government would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial barriers.     ""Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade,"" a government background paper said.     ""Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs, credit could be given to countries which effectively control the output of farm products,"" the papers said.  Reuter "
trade,"Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system.     He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.     The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking.     Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.     The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services.     Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT.""     The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries.     Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.     Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""     He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.""     Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism.     He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade.     The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising.     Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.     Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.     He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""  Reuter "
crude,"Dwindling global crude oil reserves and the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.     ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""     Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.     ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979.""     Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.     ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""     Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.  Reuter "

Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.     U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.     In his explanation, Walters said the United States took defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against American ships in the Gulf.     He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle City.     Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.     ""In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that United States forces have exercised the inherent right of self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action in response to attacks by . . .

The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship.     Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping. The French statement described the target as ""an Iranian military platform.""

The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.     Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate ""measured response.""     But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of American forces from the waterway.

""The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time recognizing the limited character of the American military reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"" the statement said.     Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution.

oilseed,"A proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.     The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year.     A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.     Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package.     ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving American consumers the information they need,"" he said.     Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.     The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.     But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal ""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.     Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils.     The committee voted largely along party lines, with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.  Reuter "

President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile waterway.     Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf.     A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the Pentagon said.      Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.     The United States said both platforms were being used to keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.  Reuter "

Referring to that attack, Howe added, ""I trust the Iranians will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense.""     At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was now involved in a full-scale war.

crude,"Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.     One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield, was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.     The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S. Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.     The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained.     U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S. forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines.     But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday.     Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.     Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.     But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.     The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.     He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death of one thousand cuts.""     But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said.     He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.     Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.     He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement.     Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.     Each side has attacked the others' shipping.  Reuter "
crude,"A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies, Western diplomats in the region said.     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.     ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S. administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.     Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action would endanger American interests.     Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a ""crushing blow.""     ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.     Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.     Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.     Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they said.     ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.     President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued.     Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran.     ""It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""     Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep.""     One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody.""     A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""     A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: ""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""  Reuter "
crude,"Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker.     The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes.     But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.     ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).     ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank.     Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq.     They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept.     U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday.     Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday.     Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape.     ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.     ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.     Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken this view after earlier clashes.  Reuter "

oilseed,"The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product  taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports.     The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S.     ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.         The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential.     But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.     Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88.     As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.

grain,"Recent announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said.     USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.     Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be ""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""     ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.         In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month.     USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.     Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.     While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.     A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.  Reuter "

The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.     The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.     Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said.     They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.     Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said.     But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.     Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.     ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.     Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict.     Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.     He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation.     The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.     The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger.     Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.

gold,"Mining group Boliden AB said it had agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.     Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish group would  be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself.     He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden.     Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden's presence in Saudi Arabia.     ""Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future,"" he said.     The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.     Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to open in modern times.

sugar,"British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a Reuter inquiry     Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's hurricane which blocked roads.     The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are cleared and supplies of beet build up again.     This is the first time in many years that a factory has been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.     Other factories are continuing to process beet normally, but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.     Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.     Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2 mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the spokesman said.     British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.     The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month, is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the campaign.     As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13 pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has severely restricted beet lifting.     Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet available.  Reuter "

Eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.

Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year.

Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own figures later in the week.     Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled 7.03 billion dlrs.     This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid revaluation of the won against the dollar.     The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.     ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said.     The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous month.     More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers, electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest between July and September.     The South Korean government originally targeted a five billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export boom.     If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with Seoul last year, government economists said.     The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to American goods and revalue the won faster.     The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday, representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.  REUTER "

Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA (BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg francs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGL director Robert Sharfe said.

The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp (SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issues the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.     Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in parity with the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.     On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-month Treasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgian franc came under pressure.     Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become increasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers, because they carry a relatively low interest rate.

""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh, an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""     Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.     The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply. Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.     The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.

""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.     Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.     The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.     The government will also repay some of its external debt, which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.     Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change.     Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states.  REUTER "
grain,"China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be 397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman as saying.     The harvest will be China's second highest in history but poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.     Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.     Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09 mln in the same 1986 period.     Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase the incentive for grain production.     China could not afford to become a major food importer, he said.     The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's 1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390 mln tonnes.  REUTER "
cpi,"The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.     The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.     The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).     The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4 pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita said. Both were proposed last month.     Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month.     In the first three months of the year, inflation was a negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5 and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics Office said.     The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September respectively, the National Statistics Office said.     It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water prices.     The government's six and eight peso wage increases would displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.  REUTER "
sugar,"A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost vodka sales, Pravda said.     The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into two billion bottles of moonshine.     At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said, this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.     ""Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count home-brew,"" Pravda said.     ""The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.""     Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

crude,"Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field, has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a statement.     Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.     Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.     Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned.     Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen.     Statoil estimates the field's total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.     Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.     Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55 pct share, Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), Deminex (Norge) A/S> (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S NHY.OL> (nine pct) and Svenska Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

sugar,"New Zealand has imposed sanctions against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.     The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year.     Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from Suva for discussions about other possible measures.     ""We won't be reacting further until these discussions with the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"" Palmer said.     The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25. Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic.     Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth had lapsed.

coffee,"Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.     A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in December and the factory should be ready by next October.     He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee Marketing Board to supply his company Unipack> with 24,000 tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.     Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.     Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the latest International Coffee Agreement.     In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.     The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of which is used to produce instant coffee.  REUTER "
crude,"The Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.     IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.     Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.     Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.     Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow.     Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products.     Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.  REUTER "
